Device emulation is an optional setting available for simple and scripted browser monitors. This setting simulates the viewport and capabilities of a mobile or tablet device using the emulation capabilities of Chrome DevTools.

Device emulation allows you to test a browser-based application using a simulated generic mobile or tablet device. Keep in mind:
* This setting does not change the network, user agent, or device type being used to execute your synthetic monitor.
* Device emulation does not allow you to install and test mobile applications.

## Requirements [#requirements]

* Chrome 100+ runtimes only
* Private locations must use [Job Manager](docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/job-manager-transition-guide/) and version 1.1.96 of synthetics-node-browser-runtime or higher

## Choose your device emulation [#devices]

When you are [adding or editing monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors), do the following:

1. Select **Device emulation**.

    <img
      title="Screenshot showing how to choose device emulation during setup"
      alt="Screenshot showing how to choose device emulation during setup"
      src={syntheticDeviceEmulation}
    />

2. Select the **Device type** and **Orientation** based on the table below:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Device type
          </th>

          <th>
            Device details
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Mobile
          </td>

          <td>
            * Resolution (Portriat): 400x800
            * Resolution (Landscape): 800x400
            * Pixel Ratio: 3
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Tablet
          </td>

          <td>
            * Resolution (Portriat): 768x1024
            * Resolution (Landscape): 1024x768
            * Pixel Ratio: 2
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
