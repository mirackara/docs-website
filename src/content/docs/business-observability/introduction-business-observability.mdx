Business observability is the practice of monitoring and analyzing the performance and behavior of a business and its processes to gain insights into its operations and identify opportunities for improvement. 

It involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources, such as transactional systems, customer interactions, and business processes, to understand how a business is functioning and identify areas that require attention.

Achieving business observability requires a holistic approach to monitoring and analyzing data from various sources across the organization. However, typically observability strategy is built in silos, and connecting the dots back to the business is reactive and extremely difficult. 
This is where Telemetry Data Platform (TDP) comes in. It provides a powerful foundation for collecting and analyzing data to drive actionable insights, allowing organizations to gain comprehensive visibility into their systems and make data-driven decisions for better business outcomes.
