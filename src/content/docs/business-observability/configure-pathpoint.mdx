Pathpoint offers a flexible configuration system that can be customized to meet the unique needs of your business. The configuration process involves writing a JSON file that specifies the desired setup. Once the configuration file is loaded, you can further fine-tune the touchpoints and their queries manually. 
This level of customization empowers you to create a tailored observability solution that fits your organization's specific requirements.

### What is a JSON configuration file?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data structure, whose basic function is to allow for the exchange of information. Through this structure, you can identify each of the elements and components that will facilitate the implementation of Pathpoint. 
This includes understanding the function of its attributes, queries, and data output.

The image above shows how each stage can be tied to a few steps, which in turn can be linked to a single touchpoint, or to a few touchpoints.
To program new stages, steps and touchpoints, you upload a New JSON Configuration file.

### Upload a new JSON configuration file

To load a new JSON configuration file:

<Steps>

<Step>

From your New Relic account, navigate to **Apps** > **Pathpoint**. Here, click on the <img src={threeLines} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Three lines" title="Three lines" /> in the top left part of the window.

<img
  title="Navigate to Pathpoint config"
  alt="Navigate to Pathpoint config"
  src={pathpointConfig}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Json configuration**.

<img
  title="JSON Configurations"
  alt="JSON Configurations"
  src={jsonConfig}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

This opens a dialog box window. Under **Description**, describe your new JSON configuration file. Next, provide a note and click **From File** to browse the JSON configuration file.

<img
  title="Upload new JSON config file"
  alt="Upload new JSON config file"
  src={uploadJson}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Locate the JSON configuration file you want to use to update your Pathpoint and click **Open**.

<img
  title="open new JSON config file"
  alt="open new JSON config file"
  src={openFile}
/>

</Step>

Finally, the Pathpoint is displayed with the updates of the particular JSON file you chose.

</Steps>

### Download the currently active JSON configuration file

Pathpoint provides the flexibility to download the current JSON configuration file directly to your computer. This feature is particularly useful if you need to make changes to the configuration file.

To download the currently active JSON configuration file:

<Steps>

<Step>

From your New Relic account, navigate to **Apps** > **Pathpoint**. Here, click on the <img src={threeLines} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Three lines" title="Three lines" /> in the top left part of the window.

<img
  title="Navigate to Pathpoint config"
  alt="Navigate to Pathpoint config"
  src={pathpointConfig}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Json configuration**.

<img
  title="JSON Configurations"
  alt="JSON Configurations"
  src={jsonConfig}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Next, click on the down arrow.

<img
  title="download active JSON config file"
  alt="download active JSON config file"
  src={downloadFile}
/>

</Step>

Your active JSON configuration file is now downloaded to your computer.
