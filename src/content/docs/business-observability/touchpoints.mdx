Touchpoints are the most granular entities within the PathPoint model and behave similarly to a specific browser application or APM (Application Performance Monitoring). Each step of a Pathpoint is connected to one or more touchpoints, and the status of every stage is determined by the culmination of its respective touchpoints.

Since touchpoint is the pulse of each Pathpoint, it is crucial to test, tune, and work with Touchpoint Queries to obtain the desired data accurately.

On this page, you learn to:

- Test a touchpoint
- Tune touchpoint thresholds
- Run touchpoint queries
- Turn off touchpoint

### Test a touchpoint

Pathpoint offers the functionality to test the validity and health of a specific touchpoint.

To test a touchpoint:

<Steps>

<Step>

Select a touchpoint to test. Right click on it and click **Queries**.

<img
  title="Example touchpoint query"
  alt="Example touchpoint query"
  src={exampleTouchpoint}
/>

It opens a dialogue box window.

</Step>

<Step>

In the dialog window, click **Test**.

<img
  title="Test touchpoint"
  alt="Test touchpoint"
  src={testTouchpoint}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Now you see the result of the test.

<img
  title="Touchpoint test validated"
  alt="Touchpoint test validated"
  src={testValidated}
/>

In this example, we see **Successfully validated**, meaning that your touchpoint is healthy.

</Step>

If the validation fails, find out why, and fix it. Then, test it again until you get the **Successfully validated** message.

<Callout variant="important">

When testing a touchpoint, if you get an **Incorrect validated** error, it might be caused by the query being ran on the wrong account ID.

Verify that you're running the query on your account in the **accountId** dropdown.

<img
  title="Incorrect validated test because of wrong AccountID"
  alt="Incorrect validated test because of wrong AccountID"
  src={incorrectValidated}
/>

</Callout>

</Steps>

### Tune touchpoint thresholds

One way to get better data from your touchpoints is to tweak their tuning configuration. Note that the initial values you see during the tuning process are defined by the JSON file uploaded to your Pathpoint. However, you can manually adjust these values later as well.

To tune a touchpoint:

<Steps>

<Step>

Select a touchpoint to test. Right click on it and select **Tune**.

<img
  title="Tune touchpoint"
  alt="Tune touchpoint"
  src={tuneTouchpoint}
/>

It opens a dialogue box window showing the threshold values for the selected touchpoint.

<img
  title="Touchpoint min & max thresholds"
  alt="Touchpoint min & max threshold"
  src={threshold}
/>

</Step>

<Step>

Enter new **Min** and **Max** threshold values and click **Save/Update**.

<img
  title="Update touchpoint thresholds"
  alt="Update touchpoint thresholds"
  src={newThreshold}
/>

</Step>

Your touchpoint is now tuned with new threshold values.

</Steps>

### Run touchpoint queries

Touchpoint queries are written in NRQL which is New Relic's SQL-like query language.
NRQL enables you to retrieve detailed New Relic data and gain insights into your applications, hosts, and business-critical activities.
Although touchpoint queries are programmed using the JSON file uploaded to your Pathpoint, you can also manually modify them, as long as you don't change the main query variable that the touchpoint is looking to get.

To run a touchpoint query:

<Steps>

<Step>

Right click on the particular touchpoint you want to work with and click **Queries**.

<img
  title="Example touchpoint query"
  alt="Example touchpoint query"
  src={exampleTouchpoint}
/>

It opens a dialogue box window.

</Step>

<Step>

In the dialog box, you see the NRQL query associated with the touchpoint.

<img
  title="Touchpoint query"
  alt="Touchpoint query"
  src={nrqlQuery}
/>

</Step>

Now, you can modify the query to get different results from the selected touchpoint.

</Steps>


### Turn off a touchpoint

If you need to work on or troubleshoot a specific touchpoint in Pathpoint, you can disable it manually. Once you've resolved any issues, you can reactivate the touchpoint to resume monitoring. 

To turn off a touchpoint:

<Steps>

<Step>

Select a touchpoint to turn off. Right click on it to open a pop-up window with options.

</Step>

<Step>

Click on the **On** symbol to turn off the touchpoint.

<img
  title="Turn off touchpoint"
  alt="turn off touchpoint"
  src={turnOffTouchpoint}
/>

</Step>

The touchpoint is now off. 

<img
  title="Off touchpoint"
  alt="Off touchpoint"
  src={offTouchpoint}
/>

Later on, you can follow the same steps to enable the touchpoint again.

</Steps>
