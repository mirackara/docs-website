This document explains:

* how environment variables are used by the .NET agent
* what environment variables are used by the agent in different installation scenarios
* how environment variables work in general

Note: for the rest of this document, the term ".NET Core" will be used to refer to .NET versions (and applications built with and for .NET versions) 5.0 and higher (which Microsoft calls simply ".NET") as well as .NET Core 2.0 through 3.1.

## How environment variables are used by the .NET agent

The New Relic .NET agent is a [.NET CLR profiler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-overview) and implements a subset of the .NET profiling API.
[Certain environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/setting-up-a-profiling-environment) must be present in the environment of a .NET process to tell the .NET runtime that the process should be profiled, and by what profiler.
Additional environment variables are used by the .NET agent itself to let it know where and how it is installed.

Note: for the rest of this document, "the profiler" refers to the component of the agent that implements the .NET profiling API.  When things are configured correctly, the CLR attaches the profiler to your .NET application.  The profiler then loads the rest of the agent into the application. 

## What environment variables are required to use the .NET agent

### Enabling profiling and identifying the correct profiler

There is a set of three environment variables used to tell the .NET runtime whether or not to enable profiling, and what profiler to use.  The names of these variables and the correct value for each depends on whether your application is built for .NET framework or .NET core.

#### .NET Framework

`COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` tells the runtime whether or not to enable profiling for an application.  Set to 1 to enable profiling, set to 0 to disable it.
`COR_PROFILER` tells the runtime which profiler to use.  The value is a GUID unique to a given profiler.  For New Relic's profiler for .NET Framework, the correct value is `{71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}`.
`COR_PROFILER_PATH` tells the runtime where to find the profiler on the system, and depends on the install type and platform.  Note that this may not be required if the agent was installed with the MSI installer, which registers the profiler DLL with the system based on the GUID set in `COR_PROFILER`.  However, it is safe to have it set anyway as long as the value is set to the correct path.

Typical values:
```
COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1
COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}
COR_PROFILER_PATH="C:\Program Files\New Relic\.NET Agent\netframework\NewRelic.Profiler.dll"

#### .NET Core

`CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING` tells the runtime whether or not to enable profiling for an application.  Set to 1 to enable profiling, set to 0 to disable it.
`CORECLR_PROFILER` tells the runtime which profiler to use.  The value is a GUID unique to a given profiler.  For New Relic's profiler for .NET Core, the correct value is `{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}`.
`CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH` tells the runtime where to find the profiler on the system.

Typical values:
```
CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1
CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}
CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH="C:\Program Files\New Relic\.NET Agent\netcore\NewRelic.Profiler.dll"
```

### Telling the profiler where the rest of the agent is

Now that the .NET runtime knows how to find the profiler and attach it to your application, other environment variables are needed to find the rest of the agent assets, which include both binary (DLL) and configuration (XML) components.  These variables are also used by parts of the rest of the agent.

Note: depending on your installation scenario, only some of these variables are be required.

#### NEWRELIC_HOME

This variable:
* is only used in the .NET framework version of the agent
* is used to find the agent configuration assets (`newrelic.config` and the instrumentation XML files in the `extensions` subfolder)
* may be used to find the agent binary assets, if they are installed in the same place as the configuration assets

Note: when the agent is installed with the MSI installer, this variable may not need to be set, since the MSI also sets a registry key (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\New Relic\.NET Agent\NewRelicHome`) with the correct value.

#### CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME

This variable:
* is only used in the .NET core version of the agent
* is used to find the agent configuration assets (`newrelic.config` and the instrumentation XML files in the `extensions` subfolder)
* may be used to find the agent binary assets, if they are installed in the same place as the configuration assets

Note: this variable always needs to be set for the .NET core version of the agent.

#### NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH

This variable is primarily used:
* When both the .NET framework and .NET core versions of the agent are installed side-by-side on the system
* When the binary components of the agent are installed in a different location on the system than the configuration assets
* When the agent is installed with the MSI installer on Windows (which does both of the above)

This variable set to a directory/folder and is used by the profiler to find the agent core DLL. If the path specified in this variable contains the `NewRelic.Agent.Core.dll` file, it is used.  If the core dll is not found, the profiler appends either `netframework` or `netcore` to the path specified, and searches for the core dll in that location.  If the core dll is still not found, the profiler falls back to searching in either `NEWRELIC_HOME` (.NET framework) or `CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME` (.NET core).

This variable is also used by the agent to load the instrumentation extension binaries from the `extensions` subfolder.  The agent always appends either `netframework` or `netcore` to the value of this variable when it is set.  If it is not set, the agent falls back to searching in `NEWRELIC_HOME\extensions` (.NET Framework) or `CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\extensions` (.NET Core).

### Values for typical installation scenarios

Now that we understand the theory, let's look at some typical installation scenarios and the correct values of these variables.

#### MSI Installer (Windows)

The MSI is easy to use because it does almost everything for you automatically, but what it is doing behind the scenes is complicated, which makes troubleshooting difficult.

The MSI installer puts different parts of the
