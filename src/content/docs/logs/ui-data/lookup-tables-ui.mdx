Our **lookups** feature lets you enrich your log data, and other New Relic-stored data, with data about your business that you define in a CSV file. 

## Why use lookups? [#overview]

You can use lookups to make your telemetry data easier to understand, group data in custom ways, and include more information that wasn't available at the time for previously reported data. From the logs UI, you can upload a CSV file and use the `lookup()` function to include the lookup data in a NRQL query. 

For reasons to use lookup tables, and how to use that data in queries, see [Query lookups](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/lookups).

## Requirements [#requirements]

 In addition to [the standard requirements for a CSV file](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180), here are our requirements for CSV files: 

* Each [account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#organization-accounts) has a limit of 20 lookup tables.
* Each row must have the same number of columns as the header and there must be at least two columns.
* Table names must conform to [the rules for event names](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/event-api/introduction-event-api/#limits), and they must:
  * Start with an alphabetic character, and can contain alphanumeric characters, underscores (`_`) and colons (`:`) 
  * Be less than 256 characters 
* Do not use [reserved words](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/#reserved-words) for table names or column header values.
* Max file size: 4 MB
* Max row count: 20K

Lookup table data can't be used in NRQL alert conditions. 

## Add and manage tables [#add-table]

Here are some important details about adding and managing tables: 

* A table uploaded in one account can't be queried by other accounts in your organization. 
* Table data is not obfuscated. Avoid uploading personal or sensitive data.
* When adding or updating a table, it can take several minutes for the new table to be available via NRQL query. 

To add a lookup table: 

* From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Logs**, and then click **Lookup tables**. 
* Click **Add a table**.
* Enter a name for the table. Each table in an account must have a unique name. You'll use this name to reference the table in NRQL queries. 

Note that when replacing an existing lookup table, the table name can't be changed.

When you delete a table, that data is no longer available in NRQL queries. When deleting a table, try to ensure its data isn't being used in any important dashboards, because removing that data can change how those dashboards appear.

## Query your data [#query]
