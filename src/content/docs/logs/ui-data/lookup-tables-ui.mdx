Our **lookups** feature lets you enrich your log data, and other New Relic-stored data, with data about your business that you define in a CSV file. 

## Why use lookups? [#overview]

When you upload a lookup table, you can then use that data to enrich your queries of New Relic data. For example, you might upload a table that maps host IDs to human-readable host names, and then use that to create a chart that displays the human-readable host names. 

Lookup tables help you: 

* Query data that isn't present in your New Relic account  
* Make your telemetry data easier to understand
* Group data in custom ways

For examples of queries using lookups, see [How to query lookup table data](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/lookups).

## Add and manage tables [#add-table]

The UI for uploading lookup tables is located in the logs UI, but you can use your lookup table data when querying any data type, not just logs. 

To find the lookup table UI: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Logs**, and then click **Lookup tables**. From there, you can upload, download, update, and delete tables. 

Some tips when adding a table: 

* The table name is what you'll use to reference that table when you write a [NRQL query](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/lookups). 
* Table data isn't obfuscated, so avoid uploading sensitive information.
* It can take several minutes for an added or updated table to be available in a NRQL query. 

When you delete a table, that data is no longer available in NRQL queries, so you should try to make sure a deleted table's data isn't being used in important dashboards.

## Query your data [#query]

If you're ready to use your table in a query, see [How to query lookup table data](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/lookups).

## Requirements and technical details [#requirements]

Some more details about lookup tables: 

* Tables can only be queried from the [account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#organization-accounts) in which the table was uploaded. 
* Each [account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#organization-accounts) has a limit of 20 lookup tables.
* Lookup table data can't be used in NRQL alert conditions. 

In addition to [the general requirements for a CSV file](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180), here are our requirements for uploading lookup table files: 

* Each row must have the same number of columns as the header and there must be at least two columns.
* Table names must conform to [the rules for event names](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/event-api/introduction-event-api/#limits)
* Do not use [reserved words](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/#reserved-words) for table names or column header values.
* Max file size: 4 MB
* Max of 20,000 rows
