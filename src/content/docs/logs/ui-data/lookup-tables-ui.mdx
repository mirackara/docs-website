Our **lookups** feature lets you enrich your log data, and other New Relic-stored data, with data about your business that you define in a CSV file. 

## Why use lookups? [#overview]

When you upload a lookup table, you can then use that data to enrich your New Relic data. For example, you might upload a table that maps host IDs to human-readable host names, and then use that to create a chart that displays the human-readable host names. Lookup tables help you: 

* Make your telemetry data easier to understand
* Group data in custom ways
* Include additional information in a query that isn't present in your New Relic account  

## Add and manage tables [#add-table]

To find the lookup table UI: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Logs**, and then click **Lookup tables**. From there, you can add, update, and delete tables.

Table data is not obfuscated. Avoid uploading sensitive information.

When adding a table, the table name must be unique in that account. That's the name you'll use to reference that table when you write a [NRQL query](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/lookups). 

When adding or updating a table, it can take several minutes for the new table to be available in a NRQL query. 

When you delete a table, that data is no longer available in NRQL queries. When deleting a table, make sure its data isn't being used in any important dashboards.

For file format requirements and other technical details, keep reading. 

## Query your data [#query]

If you've uploaded a table and want to use it in a query, see [How to query lookup table data](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/lookups).

## File requirements and technical details [#requirements]

Some technical details about lookup tables: 

* Tables can only be queried from the [account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#organization-accounts) in which the table was uploaded. 
* Each [account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/#organization-accounts) has a limit of 20 lookup tables.
* Table data is not obfuscated. Avoid uploading personal or sensitive data.
* Lookup table data can't be used in NRQL alert conditions. 

In addition to [the general requirements for a CSV file](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180), here are our requirements for lookup table CSV files: 

* Each row must have the same number of columns as the header and there must be at least two columns.
* Table names must conform to [the rules for event names](/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/event-api/introduction-event-api/#limits)
* Do not use [reserved words](/docs/data-apis/custom-data/custom-events/data-requirements-limits-custom-event-data/#reserved-words) for table names or column header values.
* Max file size: 4 MB
