    Try out these three Python tutorials to see what the New Relic platform can do with your OTLP data. We have three tutorials you can choose from, each one using the same demo Flask app. The app will calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence and generate traces, metrics, and logs.

    By working through these tutorials, you can learn skills to help you set up your own app with OpenTelemetry and New Relic.

      After you finish any of these tutorials, you can view span metrics in charts like these.
    </figcaption>
  </Side>
</SideBySide>

While each tutorial uses the same demo app, they have different approaches to help you become acquainted with OpenTelemetry and New Relic. Try out the options that are interesting to you:

    * [Tutorial 1: Run the pre-instrumented demo app:](#pre-instrum) This is the fastest way to send some demo data to New Relic and see how it is displayed in the UI. In this tutorial, the demo app has pre-loaded instrumentation and SDK configurations that follow our [best practices](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-overview/) to generate and export metrics, logs, and traces. You can inspect our code and apply relevant sections to your own apps.
    * [Tutorial 2: Monitor the demo app with the OpenTelemetry Python agent:](#python-agent) Instead of using our pre-instrumented demo app, you can use the OpenTelemetry Python agent to automatically monitor our demo app. You don't need to open the demo code and make any changes&mdash;just install and run the agent alongside the app.
    * [Tutorial 3: Set up the demo app manually:](#manual-instrum) In this track, you'll roll up your sleeves and tinker with the engine of the car. This is the approach to take if you want to have the most control over what telemetry is reported and want to see details about how it's done. You'll manually insert instrumentation into our demo app to capture telemetry and you'll configure the SDK to export that data to New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
You have two choices for exporting data from your application to New Relic via OTLP:
* Directly from your app
* Via an OpenTelemetry collector

This guide covers the first option. If you wish to export your data via a collector, check out this [collector documentation](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-basic/) for details.
</Callout>
## Requirements [#requirements]

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

* A New Relic account: Sign up for a [free account](https://newrelic.com/signup) if you don't already have one.
* Python and Pip 3.8 or higher: If you don't already have this, see these [download options](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Tutorial 1: Run the pre-instrumented demo app [#pre-instrum]

This is a great option if you want us to do the instrumentation so you can quickly see what's it's like to send data to New Relic and view it in our UI.

1. In your terminal, run the following to clone the demo app and navigate to the Getting Started Guides' `python` directory.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples.git
    cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/getting-started-guides/python
    ```
2. Set these two environment variables to send data to your New Relic account:
    * Make sure to use your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />.
    * If your New Relic data center region is EU and not US, set the endpoint to: `https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317`

      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=INSERT_YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317
3. Set these two environment variables to name the service and enable logs (logging is off by default):
      * OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=getting-started-python
      * OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp
4. In the same `getting-started-guides/python/Instrumented` directory, build and run the application:
      * Microsoft Windows:
        ```
        python app.py
        ```

      * Linux/Mac:
        ```
        python3 app.py
        ```
5. Open a new terminal tab, switch to the `getting-started-guides/python/` directory, and run the following command to generate some traffic to the application:
        * bash:
          ```
          ./load-generator.sh
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```
          .\load-generator.ps1
          ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Alternatively, you can reach the endpoint in the browser at this URL: `http://localhost:8080/fibonacci?n=INSERT_A_VALUE`. Replace `INSERT_A_VALUE` with a value from 1 to 90. To generate an error, insert an integer outside the valid range.
    </Callout>

6. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services**.
7. Click your new entity (service) called `getting-started-python` and explore the UI. For more tips about what to look for in the UI, see [View your data in New Relic](#view-data).
8. When you're finished looking at your data in the UI, shut down the application by pressing CONTROL+C in both terminal sessions.

## Tutorial 2: Monitor the demo app with the OpenTelemetry Java agent [#python-agent]

Here's a different tutorial that also uses the same demo app, but in this case, you'll use the OpenTelemetry Java agent to automatically monitor the demo app. You don't need to modify the Python source code. By using the agent, you can quickly start exporting sample data to New Relic.

The auto-instrumentation agent is a series PyPI package that dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from popular libraries and frameworks. You can also use it to capture data such as inbound requests, outbound HTTP calls, and database calls. It can be attached to any Python 3 application.

<Callout variant="tip">
  See the [official OpenTelemetry Python agent documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/automatic/) for additional configuration options.
</Callout>

To monitor our demo app with the OpenTelemetry Python agent:

1. If you haven't already done so, execute these two commands to download the demo application repository and change to a different directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples.git
    cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/getting-started-guides/python/Uninstrumented
    ```
2. Download the agent PyPI packages, which contains the agent and instrumentation libraries. You can install it on your host machine or in a virtual environment if needed.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    <Callout variant="tip">
      Instead of installing PyPI packages from the requirements.txt file, you can do this manually:
      ```
      pip install flask
      pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask
      pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
      pip install opentelemetry-distro
      ```
    </Callout>
3. Go to our [environment variables reference section](#ref-env-vars) below to see which variables you need to export and then return to these steps.
4. Continue in `getting-started-guides/python/Uninstrumented` to launch the agent with the app:
    * Microsoft Windows: `opentelemetry-instrument python app.py`
    * Linux/Mac: `opentelemetry-instrument python3 app.py`

    <Callout variant="important">
      If you're using a virtual environment, remember to run the appropriate script for your operating system (for example, `.\scripts\bin\Activate.ps1`)
    </Callout>
6. Generate traffic to the application by opening a new terminal in the `getting-started-guides/python` directory and running the load generator:
        * bash:
          ```
          ./load-generator.sh
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```
          .\load-generator.ps1
          ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Alternatively, you can reach the endpoint in the browser at this URL: `http://localhost:8080/fibonacci?n=INSERT_A_VALUE`. Replace `INSERT_A_VALUE` with a value from 1 to 90. To generate an error, insert an integer outside the valid range.
    </Callout>

7. Now that you've sent some data to New Relic, see our [instructions on viewing the data in the UI](#view-data).

8. When you're finished looking at your data in the UI, shut down the application by pressing CONTROL+C in both terminal sessions.


## Tutorial 3: Set up the demo app manually [#manual-instrum]

The previous section helped you explore automatic instrumentation with the OpenTelemetry Java agent. If you prefer to have more control over the telemetry you gather, you can try out this tutorial to learn how to add custom instrumentation. Then, you'll see how to configure the OpenTelemetry SDK to export the data to New Relic, using our recommended best practices.

Here are the steps you'll complete for this manual setup:

* [A. Download the demo application](#download)
* [B. Install dependencies](#dependencies)
* [C. Add OpenTelemetry settings](#add-otel-settings)
* [D. Add instrumentation libraries: traces](#library-traces)
* [E. Add instrumentation libraries: metrics](#library-metrics)
* [F. Add instrumentation libraries: logs](#library-logs)
* [G. Add auto-instrumentation](#auto-instrum)
* [H. Custom trace instrumentation: Create a custom span](#cust-span)
* [I. Custom trace instrumentation: Create span attribute constants](#attrib-constants)
* [J. Custom trace instrumentation: Record an exception](#record-exception)
* [K. Custom metric instrumentation: Add a custom metric counter](#metrics-cust)
* [L. Custom log instrumentation](#cust-log)
* [M. Exercise the app to generate some traffic](#exercise-app)

<Callout variant="tip">
  While you can manually configure the SDK, we will show you how to configure the SDK using the [autoconfigure option](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure), which simplifies the the process by using environment variables and system properties.
</Callout>

### A. Download the demo application [#download]

If you haven't already downloaded our demo app, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples.git
```

### B. Install dependencies [#dependencies]

To add dependencies:

1. Go to the application directory.
    ```
    cd newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/getting-started-guides/python/Uninstrumented
    ```
2. If needed, run the appropriate scripts to load your virtual environment.  Otherwise, install the following PyPI packages.  These will also install its dependencies.
    ```
    pip install flask
    pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging
    pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask
    pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
    pip install opentelemetry-distro
    ```

### C. Add OpenTelemetry Settings [#add-otel-settings]

In `app.py` add the following, and change attributes (environment, tags) as needed.

```
##########################
# OpenTelemetry Settings #
##########################
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
import uuid

OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES = {
    "service.name": "getting-started-python",
    "service.instance.id": str(uuid.uuid1()),
    "environment": "local",
    "tags.team": "newrelic"
}
```

### D. Add instrumentation libraries: traces [#library-traces]

In `app.py` add the following:

```
##########
# Traces #
##########
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

# Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to an OTLP endpoint
# SELECT * FROM Span WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(resource=Resource.create(OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES)))
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter()))
```

### E. Add instrumentation libraries: metrics [#library-metrics]

In `app.py` add the following:

```
###########
# Metrics #
###########
from opentelemetry import metrics
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import PeriodicExportingMetricReader
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.metric_exporter import OTLPMetricExporter

# Initialize metering and an exporter that can send data to an OTLP endpoint
# SELECT count(`http.server.active_requests`) FROM Metric FACET `service.name` TIMESERIES
metrics.set_meter_provider(MeterProvider(resource=Resource.create(OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES), metric_readers=[PeriodicExportingMetricReader(OTLPMetricExporter())]))
metrics.get_meter_provider()
```

### F. Add instrumentation libraries: logs [#library-logs]

In `app.py` add the following:

1. Import the logging module and set the `basicConfig` logging level to DEBUG if you haven't done this already.
    ```
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    ```
2. Add the following:
    ```
    ########
    # Logs # - OpenTelemetry Logs are still in the experimental state
    ########
    from opentelemetry import _logs
    from opentelemetry.sdk._logs import LoggerProvider, LoggingHandler
    from opentelemetry.sdk._logs.export import BatchLogRecordProcessor
    from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc._log_exporter import OTLPLogExporter

    # Initialize logging and an exporter that can send data to an OTLP endpoint by attaching OTLP handler to root logger
    # SELECT * FROM Log WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry'
    _logs.set_logger_provider(LoggerProvider(resource=Resource.create(OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES)))
    logging.getLogger().addHandler(LoggingHandler(logger_provider=_logs.get_logger_provider().add_log_record_processor(BatchLogRecordProcessor(OTLPLogExporter()))))
    ```

### G. Add auto-instrumentation [#auto-instrum]

In `app.py` add the following:

```
########################
# Auto-Instrumentation #
########################
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.logging import LoggingInstrumentor

# No OTEL SpanID/TraceID for spans/logs if you leave this out
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
LoggingInstrumentor().instrument()
```

### H. Custom trace instrumentation: Create a custom span [#custom-span]

In `app.py` add the highlighted lines. In this case, add this line right before your function definition:

```
@trace.get_tracer("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").start_as_current_span("fibonacci", kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER)
```
Here is the larger snippet:

```
@app.route("/fibonacci/<int:x>", strict_slashes=False)
@trace.get_tracer("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").start_as_current_span("fibonacci", kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER)
def fibonacci(x):

    try:
        assert 1 <= x <= 90
        array = [0, 1]
        for n in range(2, x + 1):
            array.append(array[n - 1] + array[n - 2])

        return jsonify(fibonacci_index=x, fibonacci_number=array[x])

    except (ValueError, AssertionError):
        raise ValueError("x must be 1 <= x <= 90.")

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### I. Custom trace instrumentation: Create span attribute constants [#attrib-constants]

In `app.py` add the following:

1. Create an attribute named `oteldemo.n` with the input value `x`.

    ```
    span.set_attribute("oteldemo.n", x)
    ```
2. Add another line just before the return statement to add an attribute called `oteldemo.result` with the evaluated result `array[x]`.

    ```
    span.set_attribute("oteldemo.result", array[x])

    @app.route("/fibonacci/<int:x>", strict_slashes=False)
    @trace.get_tracer("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").start_as_current_span("fibonacci", kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER)
    def fibonacci(x):
        trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.n", x)

        try:
            assert 1 <= x <= 90
            array = [0, 1]
            for n in range(2, x + 1):
                array.append(array[n - 1] + array[n - 2])

            trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.result", array[x])
            return jsonify(fibonacci_index=x, fibonacci_number=array[x])

        except (ValueError, AssertionError):
            raise ValueError("x must be 1 <= x <= 90.")

    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
    ```

### J. Custom trace instrumentation: Record an exception [#span-exception]

In `app.py` add the highlighted line.  In this case, when an exception occurs, we set the attribute `otel.status_code = ERROR`. To do this, we also need to import the `Status` and `StatusCode` modules from the `opentelemetry.trace.status package`.

```
# Everything Else
from opentelemetry.trace.status import Status, StatusCode

# The rest of the Flask application
@app.route("/fibonacci/<int:x>", strict_slashes=False)
@trace.get_tracer("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").start_as_current_span("fibonacci", kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER)
def fibonacci(x):
    trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.n", x)

    try:
        assert 1 <= x <= 90
        array = [0, 1]
        for n in range(2, x + 1):
            array.append(array[n - 1] + array[n - 2])

        trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.result", array[x])
        return jsonify(fibonacci_index=x, fibonacci_number=array[x])

    except (ValueError, AssertionError):
        trace.get_current_span().set_status(Status(StatusCode.ERROR, "Number outside of accepted range."))
        raise ValueError("x must be 1 <= x <= 90.")

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```


### K. Custom metric instrumentation: Add a custom metric counter [#metrics-cust]

In `app.py` add the highlighted line.  This creates a counter to show how many times this function runs successfully and how many times it fails to run.

```
# Everything Else
from opentelemetry.trace.status import Status, StatusCode
fib_counter = metrics.get_meter("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").create_counter("work.counter", unit="1", description="Counts the number of times this function runs")

# The rest of the Flask application
@app.route("/fibonacci/<int:x>", strict_slashes=False)
@trace.get_tracer("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").start_as_current_span("fibonacci", kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER)
def fibonacci(x):
    trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.n", x)

    try:
        assert 1 <= x <= 90
        array = [0, 1]
        for n in range(2, x + 1):
            array.append(array[n - 1] + array[n - 2])

        trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.result", array[x])
        fib_counter.add(1, {"work.type": "pass"})
        return jsonify(fibonacci_index=x, fibonacci_number=array[x])

    except (ValueError, AssertionError):
        trace.get_current_span().set_status(Status(StatusCode.ERROR, "Number outside of accepted range."))
        fib_counter.add(1, {"work.type": "fail"})
        raise ValueError("x must be 1 <= x <= 90.")

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### L. Custom log instrumentation [#cust-log]

Edit `app.py` to add the following.  In this case, we add a custom log for INFO so we know what the input and output values are.  Also, we add a custom log for ERROR when the input value is outside of the expected range.

```
# Everything Else
from opentelemetry.trace.status import Status, StatusCode
fib_counter = metrics.get_meter("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").create_counter("work.counter", unit="1", description="Counts the number of times this function runs")

# The rest of the Flask application
@app.route("/fibonacci/<int:x>", strict_slashes=False)
@trace.get_tracer("opentelemetry.instrumentation.custom").start_as_current_span("fibonacci", kind=trace.SpanKind.SERVER)
def fibonacci(x):
    trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.n", x)

    try:
        assert 1 <= x <= 90
        array = [0, 1]
        for n in range(2, x + 1):
            array.append(array[n - 1] + array[n - 2])

        trace.get_current_span().set_attribute("oteldemo.result", array[x])
        fib_counter.add(1, {"work.type": "pass"})
        logging.info("Compute fibonacci(" + str(x) + ") = " + str(array[x]))
        return jsonify(fibonacci_index=x, fibonacci_number=array[x])

    except (ValueError, AssertionError):
        trace.get_current_span().set_status(Status(StatusCode.ERROR, "Number outside of accepted range."))
        fib_counter.add(1, {"work.type": "fail"})
        logging.error("Failed to compute fibonacci(" + str(x) + ")")
        raise ValueError("x must be 1 <= x <= 90.")

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### M. Exercise the app to generate some traffic [#exercise-app]

You're ready to send some data to New Relic!

1. Go to the directory `getting-started-guides/python/Instrumented`, and build and run the app with this command:
        * Windows:
          ```
          ./gradlew bootRun
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```
          .\gradlew.bat build
          ```
    <Callout variant="tip">
      If your terminal displays the Spring ASCII, it means your app has successfully built and is running:

      <img
        alt="Screenshot showing Spring Boot ASCII logo"
        title="Screenshot showing Spring Boot ASCII logo"
        src={opentelemetrySpringBootASCIIDisplay}
      />
    </Callout>
2. Generate traffic from the application by opening a new terminal in the `getting-started-guides/java/Uninstrumented` directory and running the load generator:
        * macOS:
          ```
          ./load-generator.sh
          ```

        * PowerShell:
          ```
          .\load-generator.ps1
          ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Alternatively, you can reach the endpoint in the browser at this URL: `http://localhost:8080/fibonacci?n=INSERT_A_VALUE`. Replace `INSERT_A_VALUE` with a value from 1 to 90. To generate an error, insert an integer outside the valid range.
    </Callout>

3. Now that you've sent some data to New Relic, see our [instructions on viewing the data in the UI](#view-data).

## View your demo data in New Relic [#view-data]

No matter which tutorial you completed, you can follow the tips below for finding your data in the New Relic UI.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services**.
2. Click your new entity (service) called `getting-started-python` (or whatever name you provided).
3. Check out the details in the sections for each data type.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you are using Windows and do not see data in your New Relic account, check that you have allowed traffic through the firewall. 
</Callout>

### Traces [#traces]

Once you've reached the `getting-started-python` entity in New Relic:


1. In the left pane's **Monitor** section, click **Distributed tracing**, and then click the **Fibonacci** trace group.
    <img
      title="Screenshot showing how to find your trace group"
      alt="Screenshot showing how to find your trace group"
      src={opentelemetryPythonFindTraceGroup}
    />
2. From there, find a trace with an error and click to open it:
    <img

    />
3. Once you have the trace open, click `Show in-process spans`, and then click on the resulting span, which will open up a details panel to the right. To see the exception you recorded when a user input is invalid, click on `View span events`:
    <img
      title="Screenshot of in-process spans"
      alt="Screenshot of in-process spans"
      src={opentelemetryPythonInProcessSpans}
    />

If you completed the manual instrumentation tutorial, here's how the exception you recorded as a span will look in New Relic:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing an exception as a span event"
  alt="Screenshot showing an exception as a span event"
  src={opentelemetryPythonExceptiononSpanEvent}
/>

To view additional details that you set, such as the span attribute, span name, and status code, click on the **Attributes** tab. This pane is also where you can view additional metadata that is automatically collected by the instrumentation libraries you used in this guide, as well as metadata that is attached by New Relic:

### Metrics [#metrics]

Once you've reached the `getting-started-java` entity in New Relic, you can see a list of all collected metrics, such as runtime metrics (JVMs) and your custom counter attributes.

#### Metrics explorer [#metrics-explorer]

This is a tool that allows you to see a list of your metrics.

1. In the left pane, select **Data > Metrics explorer**, and then select `fibonacci.invocations`.

    <img
      title="Screenshot showing metrics explorer"
      alt="Screenshot showing metrics explorer"
      src={opentelemetryPythonMetricsExplorerMain}
    />
2. Under **Dimensions**, view the attributes you collected along with your custom metric, and then click on **fibonacci.valid.n**.

    <img
      title="Screenshot showing the total number of invocations of fibonacci function"
      alt="Screenshot showing the total number of invocations of fibonacci function"
      src={opentelemetryPythonMetricsExplorerDimensions}
    />

Learn more in our documentation about the [metrics explorer view](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-metrics-explorer-page).

### Logs [#logs]

Here is where to access your logs:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing the main logs page"
  alt="Screenshot showing the main logs page"
  src={opentelemetryPythonMainLogsPage}
/>

You will also see logs in your terminal:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing logs in a terminal"
  alt="Screenshot showing logs in a terminal"
  src={opentelemetryPythonLogsinTerminal}
/>

Back in your logs view, select a log, and you will see a pane open up with the log message and additional attributes that were collected, such as the associated span and trace ids, as well as metadata injected by New Relic:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing log details with trace"
  alt="Screenshot showing log details with trace"
  src={opentelemetryPythonLogDetailsWithTrace}
/>

You can navigate to the correlated distributed trace by clicking this little blue icon:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing how to find correlated trace"
  alt="Screenshot showing how to find correlated trace"
  src={opentelemetryPythonTraceRelatedtoLog}
/>

This will open a pane that displays the correlated trace, where you can view more details about the trace. For more about this page, see [OpenTelemetry in the UI: Distributed tracing page](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-distributed-tracing-page/) and [Understand and use the distributed tracing UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui/):

<img
  title="Screenshot showing the trace waterfall from the logs section"
  alt="Screenshot showing the trace waterfall from the logs section"
  src={opentelemetryPythonTraceWaterfallFromLog}
/>

You can also find the correlated log from the distributed traces view. When you select a trace that has a corresponding log, you will see that indicated as a tab, and you can view the log directly from the trace without having to switch views:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing how to see log details from a trace span"
