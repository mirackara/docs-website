When you [upload CSV-format lookup tables](/docs/logs/ui-data/lookup-tables-ui), you can use the `lookup()` function to access that data in your NRQL queries. 

## Why use lookup tables? [#why]

For why you'd use lookup tables and how to upload them, see [Lookup tables](/docs/logs/ui-data/lookup-tables-ui). 

## Basic query syntax [#basic-syntax]

Let's say you've named your table `storeNames`. This query will select all data from that table:

```sql
FROM lookup(storeNames) 
SELECT *
```

This query will select some specific attributes from that same table: 

```sql
FROM lookup(storeNames) 
SELECT store_ID, store_name, description
```

## Query examples [#query-with-data]

The primary benefit of lookup tables is that you can use queries that combine that data with your New Relic-stored telemetry data. 

Here are some query examples:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="avoid-hardcording"
    title="Avoid hardcoding a long list of hosts"
  >

This query avoids hardcoding a long list of hosts by querying host names contained in a lookup table: 

```sql
FROM Log 
SELECT count(*)
WHERE hostname IN (FROM lookup(myHosts) SELECT uniques(myHost))
```
</Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="using-join"
    title="Query using JOIN"
  >

Using `JOIN` queries can make your data more understandable. For example, this query for a custom event type uses the `storeNames` table to show the store names along with the total sales. Also notice this allows a limit of 10,000: that's because lookup tables support a higher limit than other NRQL data types.

```sql
FROM StoreEvent 
JOIN (FROM lookup(storeNames) SELECT store_ID as storeId, storeName AS name LIMIT 10000) ON shopId = storeId 
SELECT shopId, storeName, totalSales
```
</Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="status-codes"
    title="Translate status codes"
  >
Here's a query that translates status codes to readable summaries of the status: 

```sql
FROM Transaction 
  JOIN (FROM lookup(statusCodeTable) SELECT status_code, status_summary, status_definition)
  ON http.statusCode=status_code
SELECT count(*) FACET status_summary
```

Here are some example results:

  alt="Screenshot of query for lookups translating status codes"
  src={nrqlExampleStatusCodes}
/>
</Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="item-ids"
    title="Translate item IDs"
  >

This query shows how several NRQL features can work together to get business information from queries of log data. The query extracts information about items from log messages, and uses `JOIN` to get user-friendly item names and to generate a table of item names and the number of items stored.

```sql
WITH aparse(message, 'POST to carts: * body: {"itemId":"*","unitPrice":*}%') AS (URL, ItemID, Price)
FROM Log 
  JOIN (FROM lookup(itemNames) SELECT ItemID, itemName) ON ItemID
SELECT count(*) FACET itemName 
WHERE message LIKE 'POST to carts%'
SINCE 30 days ago
```

Here are some example results: 

<img
  title="Screenshot of query for lookups translating item IDs"
  alt="Screenshot of query for lookups translating item IDs"
  src={nrqlLookupQueryTranslateItemIds}
/>

</Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="geoip"
    title="Use geographic info to analyze locations"
  >

This query combines lookups and [GeoIP](/docs/logs/ui-data/parsing#geo) to find which locations have the most unsuccessful statuses: 

```sql
FROM Log 
  JOIN (FROM lookup(statusCodeTable) SELECT status_code, status_summary, status_definition)
  ON CacheResponseStatus=status_code
SELECT count(*) WHERE ClientIP.countryName IS NOT NULL AND status_summary != 'Success'
FACET ClientIP.countryName, status_summary, CacheResponseStatus
SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT MAX
```

Here are some example results: 

<img
  title="Screenshot of query for GeoIP info"
  alt="Screenshot of query for GeoIP info"
  src={nrqlLookupQueryGeoip}
/>

</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Technical details about querying [#limitations]

The maximum number of responses returned when using `LIMIT` is 20,000.

You can't use lookup data for NRQL alert conditions. 

The following NRQL functions are not supported with lookup queries: 

* `TIMESERIES`
* `COMPARE WITH`
* `EXTRAPOLATE`

But these clauses can be used if the lookup query is contained in an inner query. For an example of this, see [this query](#item-ids).
