## Fixed in this release

* Fixed framework signing to be compatible with Xcode 15.

### Other notes
* Instrumentation of async await url sessions that was added in v7.4.1 has been moved behind a feature flag. To use that feature include the `NRFeatureFlag_SwiftAsyncURLSessionSupport` flag in the `enableFeatures` function.

* Deprecation notice: The 7.4.0 version introduced a new Swift symbol upload script. See [installation instructions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation/spm-installation#configure-using-swift-package-manager) for details on how to update to the new script. In a future version of the iOS agent, the Python-based symbol upload scripts will be removed.
* This artifact was built using Xcode 14.3 with a minimum deployment target of iOS version 9.0. Compatible with CocoaPods 1.10 or higher and Swift Package Manager. The agent should be used with the latest Xcode version (Xcode 14.3 at the time of release).
* Swift Package Manager is the preferred installation method.

### Support statement

* As of iOS agent version 7.4.1, the iOS agent will consolidate previously separate XCFramework and tvOS agents into a singular iOS agent. 
* As of this release, the oldest supported version of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/xcframework-release-notes/xcframework-agent-732) is 7.3.2.
