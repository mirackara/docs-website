<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If your organization has established practices that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version, ensure that your agents are regularly updated to a version that's at most 90 days old.

## 3.25.0
### Added
   * Added Support for FastHTTP package
      * Added newrelic.WrapHandleFuncFastHTTP() and newrelic.StartExternalSegmentFastHTTP() functions to instrument fasthttp context and create wrapped handlers. These functions work similarly to the existing ones for net/http
      * Added client-fasthttp and server-fasthttp examples to help get started with FastHTTP integration
### Fixed
   * Corrected a bug where the security agent failed to correctly parse the NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_AGENT_ENABLED environment variable.


### Support statement
We use the latest version of the Go language. At minimum, you should be using no version of Go older than what is supported by the Go team themselves (i.e., Go versions 1.19 and later are supported).
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it’s available. If you can’t upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read more about keeping agents up to date. (https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/)
See the [Go agent EOL Policy](/docs/apm/agents/go-agent/get-started/go-agent-eol-policy/) for details about supported versions of the Go agent and third-party components.
