<Callout variant="important">
We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version at most 90 days old. Read more about [keeping agent up to date](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/).

As of this release, the oldest supported version is [6.10.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/ruby-agent-6100364/)
</Callout>

## v9.0.0

  Version 9.0.0 of the agent removes several deprecated configuration options and API methods, enables Thread tracing by default, adds Fiber instrumentation, removes support for Ruby versions 2.2 and 2.3, removes instrumentation for several deprecated gems, changes how the API method `set_transaction_name` works, and updates `rails_defer_initialization` to be an environment variable only configuration option.

- **Remove deprecated configuration options**

  The following configuration options have been removed and will no longer work. Please update all configs to use the replacements listed below. [PR#1782](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1782)

- **Enable Thread instrumentation by default**

  The configuration option `instrumentation.thread.tracing` is now enabled by default. This configuration allows the agent to properly monitor code occurring inside threads. In Ruby agent 9.0, instrumented code within threads will be recorded and associated with the current transaction when the thread was created.

  This may be a breaking change if you are currently using custom thread instrumentation. New transactions inside of threads will no longer be started if one already exists. [PR#1767](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1767)

- **Add Fiber instrumentation**

  `Fiber` instances are now automatically instrumented similarly to `Thread` instances. This can be [configured](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#instrumentation-fiber) using `instrumentation.fiber`. [PR#1802](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1802)

- **Removed support for Ruby 2.2 and 2.3**

  Ruby 2.2 and 2.3 are no longer supported by the Ruby agent. To continue using the latest Ruby Agent version, please update to Ruby 2.4.0 or above. [PR#1778](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1778)

- **Removed deprecated instrumentation**

  Instrumentation for the following gems had been previously deprecated and has now been removed. [PR#1788](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1788)
    - Acts As Solr
    - Authlogic
    - DataMapper
    - Rainbows
    - Sunspot

  Versions of the following technologies had been previously deprecated and are no longer supported.

    - Passenger: 2.2.x - 4.0.x
    - Puma: 2.0.x
    - Grape: 0.2.0
    - Padrino: 0.14.x
    - Rails: 3.2.x
    - Sinatra: 1.4.x, 1.5.x
    - Mongo: 1.8.x - 2.3.x
    - Sequel: 3.37.x, 4.0.x
    - Delayed_Job: 2.0.x - 4.0.x
    - Sidekiq: 4.2.x
    - Excon: below 0.55.0
    - HttpClient: 2.2.0 - 2.8.0
    - HttpRb: 0.9.9 - 2.2.1
    - Typhoeus: 0.5.3 - 1.2.x
    - Bunny: 2.0.x - 2.6.x 
    - ActiveMerchant: 1.25.0 - 1.64.x 

- **Updated API method `set_transaction_name`**

  When the method `NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name` is called, it will now always change the name and category of the currently running transaction to what is passed into the method. This is a change from previous agent versions.

  Previously, if `set_transaction_name` was called with a new transaction name and a new category that did not match the category already assigned to a transaction, neither the new name nor category would be saved to the transaction. If this method is being called in a situation in which it was previously ignored due to category differences, this will now change the name and category of the transaction. [PR#1797](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1797)

- **Removed API method: `NewRelic::Agent.disable_transaction_tracing`**

  The deprecated API method `NewRelic::Agent.disable_transaction_tracing` has been removed. Instead use either `NewRelic::Agent#ignore_transaction` to disable the recording of the current transaction or `NewRelic::Agent.disable_all_tracing` to yield a block without collecting any metrics or traces in any of the subsequent calls. [PR#1792](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1792)

- **Renamed ActiveJob metrics**

  Previously, ActiveJob was categorized as a message broker, which is inaccurate. We've updated the naming of ActiveJob traces from leading with `MessageBroker/ActiveJob` to simply leading with `ActiveJob`. [PR#1811](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1811)

- **Code cleanup**

  Thank you to community member [@esquith](https://github.com/esquith) for contributing some cleanup of orphaned constants in our code base. [PR#1793](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1793) [PR#1794](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1794) [PR#1808](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1808)

  Community member [@fchatterji](https://github.com/fchatterji) helped standardize how we reference `NewRelic` throughout our codebase [PR#1795](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1795) and updated our README's community header [PR#1815](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1815). Thanks fchatterji!

- **Bugfix: Allow rails initialization to be deferred by environment variable**

  The Ruby agent may force some Rails libraries to load on agent initialization, preventing some settings defined in `config/initializers` from being applied. Changing the initialization process to run after `config/initializers`, however, may break the configuration for other gems (ex. Roadie Rails).

  For those having troubles with agent initialization and Rails initializers, you can now pass the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_DEFER_RAILS_INITIALIZATION=true` to make the agent initialize after `config/initializers` are run. This config option can only be set using an environment variable and can't be set using YAML. [PR#1791](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/1791)

  Thanks to [@jdelStrother](https://github.com/jdelStrother) for bringing this issue to our attention and testing our fixes along the way. [Issue#662](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/issues/662)
