## Notes

* Added ability to mark errors as expected when using `newrelic.noticeError`, by adding an optional boolean: 
  * `newrelic.noticeError(error, {customAttributes}, true|false)` when there are custom error attributes.
  * `newrelic.noticeError(error, true|false)` if there are no custom error attributes.
  * `expected` errors do not affect error metrics or Apdex. 
* updated @grpc/grpc-js from 1.8.8 to 1.8.9

### Support statement:

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly to ensure that you're getting the latest features and performance benefits. Additionally, older releases will no longer be supported when they reach [end-of-life](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software).
