<Callout title="PREVIEW"> 
    This feature is currently in preview.
</Callout>

When your application has exploitable vulnerabilities, it means that someone could take advantage of a misconfiguration to access sensitive information. To help prevent that from happening, install our interactive applications security testing (IAST) to assist in finding exploitable vulnerabilities.

You can use IAST to test applications written in the following languages:
- Java
- NodeJS
- Go

## Test your application [#install]

<Callout variant="important">
  Run IAST with non-production deployments only.

  IAST tests your applications for any exploitable vulnerability by replaying the generated HTTP request with vulnerable payloads. Run IAST only on non-production deployments to avoid exposing vulnerabilities on your production software.
</Callout>

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST**, and click **Start trial**.
2. Read the pre-release software terms, and click **Accept** if you agree to them.
3. On the left hand-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Install**.
4. In the installation window, select the language of your application and complete the steps.

    </figcaption>

5. Once you've completed all the steps, click **See your data** to see an overview of your tested applications.
6. After you've installed your application, use the APIs from your application so that New Relic can start looking for exploitable vulnerabilities. You can do so by running your own tests against your APIs.

## Manage exploitable vulnerabilities for an application [#app-vuln]

To manage exploitable vulnerabilities for a specific application, do the following:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Applications**.
2. Under **Tested applications**, search for your application or select it.
3. In the **Application vulnerabilities** tab, see all the exploitable vulnerabilities found in your application. 
    <img
        title="Overview of the exploitable vulnerabilities found in your application."
        alt="Overview of the exploitable vulnerabilities found in your application."
        src={iastAppVuln}
    />

    <figcaption>
        **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Applications**, and select your application.
    </figcaption>

4. In the **Exploitable vulnerabilities** table, select an exploitable vulnerability to explore details about the vulnerability and understand the specifics of how to address it.
    <img
        title="Exploitable vulnerability details and how to fix it."
        alt="Exploitable vulnerability details and how to fix it."
        src={iastVulnDetails}
    />

    <figcaption>
        **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Applications**, select your application, and select a vulnerability.
    </figcaption>

5. Additionally, in the **Application coverage** tab, see how vulnerable each part of your application is. 
    <img
        title="Vulnerability coverage of your application."
        alt="Vulnerability coverage of your application."
        src={iastAppCoverage}
    />

    <figcaption>
        **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Applications**, select your application and see the **Application coverage** tab.
    </figcaption>

## Manage exploitable vulnerabilities for all your applications [#all-apps-vuln]

To manage all the exploitable vulnerabilities across your application portfolio, do the following:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Exploitables**.
    <img
        title="Overview of the exploitable vulnerabilities found in all your applications."

    <figcaption>
        **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Exploitables**.
    </figcaption>


2. Under **Detected exploitable vulnerabilities**, select an exploitable vulnerability, regardless of the application it belongs to, and explore details about the vulnerability and understand the specifics of how to address it.
    <img
        title="Exploitable vulnerability details and how to fix it."

## Fix untested applications [#untested-apps]

If you have an application in New Relic that hasn't been tested for exploitable vulnerabilities, do the following:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST**.
2. Under **Protect untested applications**, select the application you want to test or click **See all** to search for it.
3. From the **Untested applications** table, select the application you want to test.
    <img
        title="Untested applications table"
        alt="Untested applications table"
        src={iastUntestedApps}

        **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** > **All capabilities** > **IAST** > **Protect untested applications** > **See all**.
    </figcaption>

4. In the **Enable IAST** window, follow the steps to update your application configuration so it can be tested for exploitable vulnerabilities.
    <img
        title="Enable IAST for your untested application"
        alt="Enable IAST for your untested application"
        src={iastEnableIast}
