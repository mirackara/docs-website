When customers have both Istio and New Relic Kubernetes integration solution installed and enabled in their environments, issues may arise.
This page summarizes all potential issues with Istio when New Relic Kubernetes integration is installed.

    When Istio is enabled in customer clusters, the Istio-deployed Envoy proxies have a Prometheus metric endpoint that exposes Prometheus metrics. 
    These metrics are associated with a dedicated `cluster_name` as `xds-grpc`. If you also enable the Prometheus agent in New Relic Kubernetes 
    integration solution, the agent will collect these Envoy related metrics with `cluster_name` as `xds_grpc` aside the metrics with `cluster_name`
    defined through `global.cluster`.
    
    Run the following query to get a full list of Envoy proxy metrics, 
    
    ```
    SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM `Metric` WHERE cluster_name = 'xds-grpc' SINCE 1 week ago
    ```
