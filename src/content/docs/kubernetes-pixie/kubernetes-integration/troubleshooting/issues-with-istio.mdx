If you have both Istio and the New Relic Kubernetes integration installed and enabled in your environment, issues may arise.
This page describes one issue with Istio when the New Relic Kubernetes integration is installed.

## Problem

When Istio is enabled in customer clusters, the Istio-deployed Envoy proxies have a Prometheus metric endpoint that exposes Prometheus metrics.

These metrics are associated with a dedicated `cluster_name` as `xds-grpc`. If you also enable the Prometheus agent in New Relic Kubernetes integration, the agent will collect these Envoy-related metrics with `cluster_name` as `xds_grpc` in addition to the metrics with `cluster_name` defined through `global.cluster`.

Run the following query to get a full list of Envoy proxy metrics:

```
FROM `Metric`
SELECT uniques(metricName)
WHERE cluster_name = 'xds-grpc' SINCE 1 week ago
```
