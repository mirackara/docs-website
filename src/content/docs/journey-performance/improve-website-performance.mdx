A good websiteâ€”you know it when you surf it, right? It's so fast you never notice the load time. It's available whenever you need it. And, of course, it's error-free. But _measuring_ your site's performance, let alone improving it, is a tricky task.

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to improve your site's experience. You'll start by "instrumenting" your site, which means adding some JavaScript code that measures the actual end-user experience for each and every visit. From there, you'll learn how to understand how your site is performing today, where you can improve, and how to keep an eye on things in future.

## Improve your website's performance

<Steps>

<Step>
### Instrument your site

Before you can improve your site's performance, you need to see what's going on. New Relic monitoring always starts with an **integration**, a piece of code that collects data from a technology you care about and reports it to New Relic. 

To monitor the front end of your website, the integration you want is our **Browser monitoring agent**. This is a small snippet of JavaScript that you'll include in your HTML `<head>`, very similar to Google Analytics or other scripts. 

There are two basic ways to install the Browser monitoring agent: 

<Tabs>
    <TabsBar>
        <TabsBarItem id="js-snippet">Copy-paste install</TabsBarItem>
        <TabsBarItem id="apm-agent-deploy">APM agent install</TabsBarItem>
    </TabsBar>

    <TabsPages>
        <TabsPageItem id="js-snippet">
            You can deploy just the agent by copy-pasting the JavaScript snippet into whatever part of your code generates the `<head>` for your webpage.

            If you're monitoring your backend with one of our APM agents, the APM agent can automatically inject the Browser monitoring agent into the appropriate part of your webpage.

### Review your core web vitals

<SideBySide>
  <Side>
    Core web vitals are metrics that give you insight into your users' experience with your site. Low scores often indicate a poor experience, which can leave users irritated. New Relic has <InlinePopover type="browser" /> capabilities you can use to track these metrics, and you can see our tutorial on core web vitals for more information.

### Fix latency issues

<SideBySide>

  <Side>
    High latency can frustrate users and even cause them to stop using your site altogether. You can use <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> to locate latency issues across your services and begin fixing them. For more in-depth information, check out our [tutorial](/docs/journey-performance/fixing-high-latency/) on addessing latency issues.

### Reduce JavaScript errors

<SideBySide>

  <Side>

    JavaScript errors can cause numerous issues with your site, any one of which could negatively impact the front-end experience for your customers. New Relic <InlinePopover type="browser" /> features a **JS errors** page for your integrated apps, and we have multiple other ways to track them listed in our tutorial.

    />

  </Side>

</SideBySide>

</Step>

<Step>

### Establish benchmarks

<SideBySide>

  <Side>

    Sometimes, site performance can dip below acceptable levels without necessarily causing major errors. Even without major errors or spikes, your site could still be performing poorly enough to affect customer satisfaction. You can create service-level benchmarks to help track your sites performance, and identify issues before they become problems. See our tutorial for more information.
