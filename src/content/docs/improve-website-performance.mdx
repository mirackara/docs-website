A good websiteâ€”you know it when you surf it, right? It's so fast you never notice the load time. It's available whenever you need it. And, of course, it's error-free. But _measuring_ your site's performance, let alone improving it, is a tricky task.

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to improve your site's experience. You'll start by "instrumenting" your site, which means adding some JavaScript code that measures the actual end-user experience for each and every visit. From there, you'll learn how to understand how your site is performing today, where you can improve, and how to keep an eye on things in future.

## Improve your website's performance

<Steps>

<Step>
### Instrument your site

Before you can improve your site's performance, you need to see what's going on. New Relic monitoring always starts with an **integration**, a piece of code that collects data from a technology you care about and reports it to New Relic. 

To monitor the front end of your website, the integration you want is our **Browser monitoring agent**. This is a small snippet of JavaScript that you'll include in your HTML `<head>`, very similar to Google Analytics or other scripts. 

There are two basic ways to install the Browser monitoring agent:

    <TabsBar>
        <TabsBarItem id="js-snippet">Copy-paste install</TabsBarItem>
        <TabsBarItem id="apm-agent-deploy">APM agent install</TabsBarItem>
    </TabsBar>

    <TabsPages>
        <TabsPageItem id="js-snippet">
            You can deploy just the agent by copy-pasting the JavaScript snippet into whatever part of your code generates the `<head>` for your webpage.

            If you're monitoring your backend with one of our APM agents, the APM agent can automatically inject the Browser monitoring agent into the appropriate part of your webpage.
