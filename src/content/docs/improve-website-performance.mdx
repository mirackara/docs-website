title: 'Improve your website's performance'
---
A good websiteâ€”you know it when you see it, right? It's so fast you never notice the load time. It's available whenever you need it. And, of course, it's error-free. But _measuring_ your site's performance, let alone improving it, is a tricky task.

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to improve your site's experience. You'll start by "instrumenting" your site, which means adding some JavaScript code that measures the actual end-user experience for each and every visit. From there, you'll learn how to understand how your site is performing today, where you can improve, and how to keep an eye on things in future.
