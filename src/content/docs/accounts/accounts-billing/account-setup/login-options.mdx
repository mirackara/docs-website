There are several ways a New Relic user can log into a New Relic organization: 

* Email and password: The default login method, which requires a user's email address and a password.
* Social login: You can use Google, Google Workplace, and GitHub to sign up for and log into New Relic. 
* Single sign-on: For identity provider login options, see [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim). 

Having trouble logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/).

For managing how your users log in, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more).

## Billable user count is based on email address [#email]

Within a [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure), user records with the same email address will be considered a single user. For example: if you add a full platform user to more than one account in an organization, as long as those user records have the same email address, we regard them as representing a single user. For more on user rules, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). 

## Switch between user records [#switch]

For users with access to more than one New Relic user record, see [Switch between users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found).
