There are several ways a New Relic user can log into a New Relic organization: 

* Email and password: The default login method, which requires a user's email address and a password.
* Social login: You can use one of several third-party services to sign up to New Relic and to log in, including: Google, Google Workplace, GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. For some details about using social login, see [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems#social-login).
* Single sign-on: For identity provider login options, see [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).

## How we differentiate and track users [#email]

A [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) can have multiple accounts, and can assign users to one or more accounts with our [user management solutions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users). 

We differentiate users in an organization by their email address. This means if you add a user to multiple accounts, as long as those user records have the same email address, they're treated as a single user. For more on user rules, see [User billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). 

## Switch between user records [#switch]

For users with access to more than one New Relic user record, see [Switch between users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found).
