metaDescription: "For New Relic pricing, an explanation of how data ingest is calculated for billing purposes."
---

For [our pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the data ingested by your New Relic organization is one billing factor.
 
## View data ingest in the UI [#ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

## Data options: Data Plus and original [#data-prices]

Your organization's price per GB of ingested data varies depending on which data option you have: Data Plus or original. The Data Plus option gives you a more powerful set of features and query limits. 

Here are comparisons of these options. Notes about this comparison: 

* Data Plus is available only for Pro and Enterprise edition. 
* Prices and limits are monthly. Prices are in USD. 
* A New Relic organization can have only one option at a time: Data Plus or original. 
* See [Azure Native New Relic Service limitations for Data Plus](#azure-native-data-plus).

### Azure Native New Relic Service details [#azure-native-data-plus]

The [Azure Native New Relic Service](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/azure-native) uses Data Plus, but with these limitations: 

* Available US data center region only
* FedRAMP not available 
* HIPAA not available
* Historical data export not available
* Vulnerability Management not available

## What counts as billable ingested data? [#usage-calculation]

In the context of [New Relic pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), "ingested data" refers to the data saved to New Relic by your organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it's not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

Here are some notes about New Relic features and data that **do not** count towards ingest and billing:
* [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) doesn't count towards billing.
* [Applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-applied-intelligence) data reported from third-party services counts towards billing but internally generated data (for example, `NrIncidentEvent` data) does not.
* [Golden metrics](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial) don't count towards billing. (For details about how those are defined, see our [entity definitions](https://github.com/newrelic/entity-definitions)). 
* Synthetic monitor checks don't count towards billable ingested data. For details on synthetics billing, see [Synthetics limits and pricing](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits). 
* Usage-tracking data (for example, `NrUsage`, `NrMTDConsumption`, `NrConsumption`) doesn't count towards billing.
* Data related to organization and account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`) doesn't count towards billing.

To understand your usage, see the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

## Other calculation details [#calculation-details]

* In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that's counted as 100 GBs.

## Other usage-related billing factors [#other-factors]

Besides ingested data, there can be other platform-usage options that affect billing: 

* [Synthetics checks exceeding free amounts](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/monitor-limits)
* [Extended data retention](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention) 

## Related docs [#related-docs]

* For more on how data is ingested, see [Manage data ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).
* For how to estimate data ingest and cost, see [Data ingest estimator](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost).
* For how to query usage, see [Query and alert on usage](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

## Free tier data ingest limits [#free-tier-limits]

If your organization is on our [free tier](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#free) and your data ingest exceeds 100 GBs in a calendar month, your data ingest is disabled until the beginning of the next month. Note that when ingest is disabled, the re-enabling of ingest at the start of the following month may take up to 24 hours.
