Intro - short summary

## End of life of UI for original pricing model [#eol]

Short description of what end of life is about

## What customers are affected? [#who-is-affected]

Customers on the [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing)

## What you can do [#actions]

Query data instead of using UI

Any info we can give about upgrade to new pricing model? I assume they're already being pressured to switch as it is so maybe we don't need to say anything?  

## Details about querying [#querying]

Some overview info about queries: it's attached to NrDailyUsage

Querying in query builder in UI will show you that account, and any child accounts. You can also use NerdGraph for cross-account querying. 

We'll give you some example queries below that give you the same info shown in the UI:
