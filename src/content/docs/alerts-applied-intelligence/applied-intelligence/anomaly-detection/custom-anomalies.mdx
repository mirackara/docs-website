Custom anomalies allow your team the most versatility when detecting unusual behavior in your system. Not only are they flexible and dynamic, custom anomalies provide your team with the capability to alert on any NQRL condition and to adjust and optimize your thresholds. Custom anomalies are built using the same advanced tuning settings as static alerting so you can ensure your team sees only incidents that are important to you.

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI** and select **Anomaly detection** in the left navigation panel to see the anomalies.



This page includes these features:

  * Add a configuration.
  * View anomalies.
  * Remove configuration. 





## How to create a custom anomaly [#create-custom-anomaly]

Follow these steps to create your custom anomaly:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI** and select **Anomaly detection** in the left navigation panel.

2. Click **+ Add a configuration**.

3. Add a clear and meaningful name for your anomaly configuration to identify it easily.

4. Select an account to use with this anomaly.

5. Select the applications and services you want to include.

6. Select the signals your want to monitor for this anomaly. By default, all of them are selected but you can decide which one you want to monitor. These are the options:

    * [Web throughput](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#throughput).
    * Non-web throughput.
    * Error rate. To understand how error rate is calculated, see [Application error rate example](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/application-error-rate-example-v2).
    * Web response time.
    * Non-web response time.

7. Select where you want to receive the notifications about this anomaly. These are the options:

    * Slack. You need to select a Slack channel to send notifications when the anomalies open and close.
    * Webhock. Add the URL to send the notification messages.
    * No notifications. If you prefer not to receive notifications, select this option.

8. Click  **Save configuration**.





## How to configure notifications for anomaly [#notifications-anomalies]

We also set up notifications for anomalies to be delivered in Slack, and we set up a webhook to deliver messages when we need them.

These events are also available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After we set up an anomaly detection configuration (a group of apps we're interested in), we can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via incident intelligence. 



### Configure anomaly thresholds [#configure-anomalies]

After selecting 'anomaly' for threshold type, you'll need to set your threshold. This sets the criteria that you want to be notified on. 

To do this you'll need to:
* Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both.
* Set the behavior that will trigger an incident (for example: "deviating for more than five minutes") 
* Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source by adjusting the sliding bar to more violations or fewer violations. This bar calculates how many standard deviations away from the prediction you want to be notified.

<img

  alt="A screenshot demonstrating how to configure custom anomalies"
  src={alertsConfigureYourAnomalyThresholds}
/>

When your data escapes the predicted "normal" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification.

Here are some tips for setting anomaly thresholds:

* Set the [anomaly direction](#upper-lower) to monitor violations that happen either above or below the anomaly.
* Set the preview chart to either [2 days or 7 days](#days) of displayed data. This is not applicable for [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).
* Use the slider bar to adjust the  **Critical** threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the anomaly. The tighter the band around the anomaly, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate.
* Optional: You can create a [**Warning** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/set-thresholds-alert-condition#threshold-levels) (the darker gray area around the anomaly).
* For NRQL alerts, see the [allowed types of NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries#threshold-types).
* If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.)

### Faceted anomaly conditions [#anomaly-facets]

Once you've run a faceted NRQL query for an anomaly condition, you can scope your results to a single anomaly.

<img
  title="Faceted anomalies"
  alt="A screenshot depicting faceted anomalies"
  src={alertsFacetedAnomalies}

The single time series shows the anomaly, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any.

  src={alertsFacetedAnomaliesTwo}

### Anomaly direction: select upper or lower ranges [#anomaly-direction]

You can choose whether you want the condition to look for behavior that goes above the predicted value ("upper") or that goes below the predicted value ("lower"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the prediction direction selector.

Example use cases for this:
* You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down.
* You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would indicate a problem.

Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different anomaly direction settings. The red areas represent violations.

### Rules governing calculation of the predicted value [#anomaly-rules]

The algorithm for calculating the prediction is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities:

* **Age of data** On initial creation, the prediction is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and prediction type. After its creation, the algorithm takes into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the predicted value will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there isn't enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the prediction and thresholds will become.
* **Consistency of data** For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the prediction. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds.
* **Regular fluctuations** For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the prediction algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them.

### Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days [#preview-chart]

When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying **Since 2 days ago** or **Since 7 days ago**. These selections are **not** the time period used to compute anomaly; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the anomaly, see the [algorithm rules](#anomaly-rules). Not applicable for [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries).
