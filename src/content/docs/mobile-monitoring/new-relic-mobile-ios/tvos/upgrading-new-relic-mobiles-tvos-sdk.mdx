You must be the account Admin to install, configure, and upgrade the iOS agent. For information about the latest version, refer to the [release notes](/docs/releases/ios).

## Replacing your tvOS framework [#v1]

First, you'll need to replace the earlier version of your iOS agent in your Xcode project:

1. From the Project Navigator (**CMD 1**) in Xcode, search for **NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework**.
2. Right-click or control-click **NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework**, and select **Show in Finder**.
3. Drag **NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework** to the trash.
4. Verify that the Xcode project highlights the reference to **NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework** in red.
5. Right-click or control-click **NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework**, and select **Delete** to remove the obsolete reference from the project.

Then, continue with the installation process in the UI at **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Installation**.
