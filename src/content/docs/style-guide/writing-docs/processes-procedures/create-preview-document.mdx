The preview docs site hosts preview docs for upcoming features that we share with customers.

Unlike the public docs site, the preview docs site is not publicly editable and does not appear in search engine results. Additionally, the site is not indexed, so you can't navigate from one preview doc to another. Because the preview docs site is located in a different repo than the public docs site, contributing looks a little different.

Before you get started, make sure you have done the following:

## Set up your local environment [#do-first]

1. Go to the [`beta-docs-site repo`](https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site). If you do not have access, contact the #doc-eng-help Slack channel for help.
2. Clone the beta-docs-site repo on your computer.
3. Make sure you're working in the correct repo on Github Desktop.
4. Create a branch off the `main` branch.
  
## Create a new preview doc [#create-docs]

Once you're in your working branch:

1. Using your text editor, create a new `.mdx` file or copy an existing preview doc for the frontmatter template.
2. Save the file in `/src/content/docs/`.
3. Write your content, making sure to include any info about accessing the preview feature you're documenting.
4. Commit your changes and create a pull request.
5. Share the preview link with reviewers and implement any feedback.
6. Merge the final PR.
7. Create the official link by pasting the file path name after `https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/` (For example: `https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/new-feature-name`)
8. Provide reviewers the official link to share with customers.

## Optional boiler plate text [#boiler-plate]

When writing a doc for preview, you may want to include a [callout](/docs/style-guide/formatting/callouts/) with boiler plate text at the top of the doc. This text orients your reader, providing them with important information about the feature's availability.
For example, boiler plate text for a preview doc might read:

<Callout variant="caution" title="Preview">
  This feature was released on January 1, 202X and is in preview. To get access to it, reach out to your account manager.
</Callout>

## Additional guidance for internal contributors [#internal-contributors]

Often, when Internal Contributors want to make a change to a preview doc, they’ll make a fork of the beta-docs-site repo. Because we don’t accept PRs from forked repos, you’ll need to ask the #doc-eng-help Slack channel for access to the repo. Once you receive access, you can make a branch off the beta-docs-site repo. If you've already created a PR from a forked repo, you'll need to close it and create a new PR that branches off the beta-docs-site repo.
