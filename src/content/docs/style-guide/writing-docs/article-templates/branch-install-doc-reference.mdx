This is a reference for the components that make up our branched install component.

To get started with the branched install, see [Get started with branched install](/docs/style-guide/writing-docs/article-templates/intro-branch-install-doc). 

The branched install docs are controlled by a configuration YAML file that maps out the relationships between different options. The YAML outlines when and how the pieces of content (located in .mdx files) populate the doc. As users make option selections, the YAML swaps those snippets in and out.

## Components [#new-components]

To see the branched install component in action, see [our branched install implementations](??). The main components are:

* Option selection boxes (sometimes referred to as "tile dropdowns") where the choices a user makes dictates what content is displayed
* Numbered steps 
* Option for embedded config file that users can input values into 
* Installation feedback form (`<InstallFeedback />`)

## How it works [#how]

The install docs live in the `install` directory. There is a single `.yaml` file that defines how and when specific content is swapped in and out of the doc. The specific pieces of content are represented as `.mdx` files.

## Directory overview [#install-directory]

The install framework content lives in `src/install`. 

To create a new install doc, add a directory to `install`.

Your directory structure needs to look like this:

```
install
|--assets (used for install images)
|--config (used for the install yaml files)
   |--agent-config (used for the agent config yml files)
|--specific-install (used for a specific install doc)
   |--sub-directory1 (used for .mdx files that will be swapped in)
   |--sub-directory2 (used for .mdx files that will be swapped in)
   |--sub-directoryx (you can have as many sub-directories as you need)
```

When you start a new branching doc, create a parent directory under the `install` directory. This is where all of the files for your branching doc live.

## The branching YAML file [#yaml-overview]

The branching doc YAML file is a highly customizable way to generate a wide variety of custom, interactive content. Being a YAML file, it's extremely important to pay attention to indents and to make sure that every piece of the YAML file is correct. 

When you swap in MDX content in your YAML file, the specific MDX file needs to be local to your install doc directory (for example, Java). Although it might be tempting to link to content anywhere on the docs site for the purposes of reuse, this will cause your doc to break.

### Verify YAML script [#verify-yaml]

Given how easy it is to break any YAML file, our helpful engineering team has created a useful script to check for common problems you might see in your YAML file.

In your terminal, go to the `docs-website` repo directory and run this command:

`yarn verify-install-page YOUR_BRANCHING_DOC_DIRECTORY_NAME`

For example, for the Java branching doc, you'd use:

`yarn verify-install-page java`

because the Java branching doc is located at `src/install/java`.

This script checks the following in your YAML file:

* The `agentName` value matches the folder name in `src/install/YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME`.
* The `agentName`, `agentType`, `title`, and `appInfo` fields aren't blank.
* The `appInfo` `placeholder` field isn't blank.
* The step and overrides file paths are valid paths and point to real files.
* All `overrides` have a `selectedOptions` value.
* General YAML syntax issues, such as an extra quotation mark or an invalid indent.

### A sample YAML file [#sample-yaml]

This is a sample YAML file. You can find definitions of these fields in the next section.

```

```

## YAML field name details [#yaml-fields]

* agentName: the directory name where everything lives, also tied to the URL (/install/java)
* title: name of the doc, free text field
* introFilePath: the intro text for the page
* agentConfigFilePath: where the agent yml file lives
* appInfo: where you define the dropdowns
    * optionType: value used for overrides, used for query parameters, also used in places for component type appInfo.mdx, appInfoConfigOption, giving a name to the variable used elsewhere on the page 
    * label: name for the dropdown
    * placeholder: text that's there before you selected anything
* options
    * value: the variable for the name for the tile, hooks into the query param for the URL
    * displayName: the label of the tile
    * logo: this is an optional path to an image for the tile
    * icon: use this if you want to use an icon instead of an image (icon name="fe-server”)
    * recommendedGuided: Boolean, determines whether guided install content displays (optional)

* steps: steps section defines all the steps on the page, the order these are listed determines the order of the steps
    * filePath: this is the path to a .mdx file (default file content)
    * overrides: determines if an .mdx file is swapped in 
        * skip: Boolean, removes content
        * selectedOptions: this section hooks into the selected values in the app config to replace content
            * optionType: this connects to the appInfo variable name
            * options
                * value: connects to the specific item in a specific dropdown


## Branching MDX files [#mdx-overview]

When working with this install framework, there are specific MDX files to be aware of. The different MDX content types are specified via the `componentType` frontmatter field.

The different component types are:

* `intro`
    * Referenced in the YAML by `introFilePath`.
    * This is the content at the top of the page.
    * Used for intro content.
* `default` 
    * A freeform MDX file.
    * Use this for most of your content.
* `appInfo`
    * This is used to display the dropdown content, as well as content that's shown when the `recommendedGuided: true` flag is added to a step.
* `appInfoConfigOption` 
    * This is used to show dropdown content.
* `agentConfig` 
    * This is used to show the APM agent YML config file.

### A sample MDX file [#sample-mdx]

```
--- 
 headingText: Let's begin
 componentType: default
 ---

 Boil your water. 
```

### The appInfo MDX file [#sample-appinfo]

```
---
 componentType: appInfoConfig
 headingText: Tell us about your java app
 descriptionText: Select how your app is deployed and your framework. The page updates with the instructions you need for your exact Java setup, so you can start monitoring your app’s performance.
 ---

 ### We recommend the guided install for your app

 A single CLI-command you can run on your system to start monitoring your Java app.
 Java apps deployed via Tomcat, Wildfly/Jboss, and Jetty (standalone).

 <Button variant="primary">Guided Install</Button>

 If you would prefer to install manually you can follow the steps below.
```

### The agentConfig MDX file [#sample-agentconfig]

The `agentConfig` MDX file points to the appropriate config file in the install directory and controls which lines in the config file are editable.

```
 ---
 componentType: agentConfig
 headingText: Choose your download option
 descriptionText: Set your app name and license key. Then download your custom config file. You can also use more advanced config setting, see our docs.
 inputOptions: 
   - label: 'Name your app'
     name: "My app name"
     codeLine: 29
     defaultValue: 'My Application'
     toolTip: 'some random info text' 
   - label: 'Enter your '
     url: 
       href: 'http://one.newrelic.com/api-keys'
       title: 'New Relic license key'
     name: licenseKey
     codeLine: 15
     defaultValue: '12345'  
 configFilePath: 'assets/newrelic.yml'
 ---

 When using the config file, we recommend you: 
   * change the default `newrelic.yml` permissions to read/write only for the owner of the application server process.
   * make sure `newrelic.yml` is part of your backup routine.
   * use the [New Relic Diagnostics CLI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/run-diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/) to validate your settings, either before or after you deploy.
