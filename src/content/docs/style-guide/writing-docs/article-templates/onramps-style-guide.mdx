Onramps content is information that appears our UI when a user clicks a <img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmOnrampsIcon}
/>
 icon. This content is meant to be truncated and contextualized to where the user is and what they need to know to perform a task.

## How should I name the titles of onramps content?

### FAQ structure

When applicable, use an FAQ format where the headers are in question format.

Example:

**Can I get notifications for issues?**
You can get notifications through email, Slack, Jira, and more. To learn how to set up notifications, see [Introduction to alert notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications/).

### Regular headers

If FAQ format is not applicable, use our standard headers for titles.

Example:

**Forward logs to New Relic**
Forwarding logs to New Relic allows you to have all logs in one place.

## What if a tile has two states (active and empty)?

A tile is something that's clickable and may or may not contain data, depending on if customers have set it up. This is called an active vs. an empty state, and it's something to consider when writing onramps content. If the tile has no data, it's in empty state, and if the user clicks on it, they may be directed to a set up page. If it has data, it's in active state, and our onramps content will want to help users interpret the data.

For example, here's the Incidents tile in active and empty states, and the content that touches on both scenarios.

<table>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmActiveEmptyState}
/>
            </td>
            <td>
                **What are service levels?**
                Service levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view.

                When a service level’s error budget is exceeded, you’ll see these violation types:
                * Non-compliant means you've consumed all of the error budget for this period. So be careful if you need to deploy, and plan some work to improve your SLs.
                * At risk means your error budget is nearly consumed, and you should be more cautious for the rest of the period.


                **How do I view/create a service level?** 
                To add a new service level, go to Service Levels and click Add a service level. 
                
                **How do I get notified for service level violations?**
                Go to **Service Levels**, click a service level, and click **Alert**.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## How long should the content be?

If you're not using collapsers, keep the character count under 1200 for the entire onramps section.

## How should I bold/italicize to emphasize something?

Style guide for how to emphasize, considering we can’t use backtick code formatting. But assume we can use bold, and maybe we can be okay with italics? Or quotes? 


Rules around: if it’s not the main place where the feature is (like an overview tile) then it’s not the place to include a lot of detail. 
What are our rules around saying things like ‘click this thing to see more detail’? I wonder if some of this might be obvious and we might have rules like not doing that.  
What are rules around linking to docs? Should we often do it? Minimally do it? (my thought is it is very helpful so we should do it a lot, esp considering these must currently be very short).
Things to consider
When a user clicks on an icon and they navigate to a different page, the onramps content persists.
