Our onramps content is the help text that appears in the UI when you click the **?** icon. The purpose of in-product help is to help users understand the UI, interpret performance data, and New Relic solutions with their system problems. Onramps provide more detail than a [tooltip](https://one-core.newrelic.com/components/tooltip/). Ideally, they give users essential info so they can stay in the product and keep working, rather than switching over to read the docs. 

When writing onramps, include information that helps users:
* Understand what a feature is used for, and the benefits of the feature beyond the existing heading or other content. 
* Perform specific tasks.
* Understand what to do next. Are there recommended follow-on actions? The Apdex troubleshooting onramp provides a nice example for this. It tells users: "Compare the Apdex chart with other charts (like Web transaction time and Error rate) to look for the causes for the Apdex change."

## Content guidelines

* Be clear and concise. Contextual help should be clear and concise. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that users may not understand.
* Use second-person point of view to address the reader. Address the user as "you", such as "We couldn't find your data." 
* Answer the "why" and "how" questions. For example, a user might ask themselves, "Why is this important to me?" or "How do I use this information to improve my app performance?" Write content to help answer these questions, to understand the larger context of their application. For example, a user can learn about how APM and logs relate to each other, or how APM and infrastructure relate to each other.
* Provide additional context to clarify ambiguous or confusing areas in the product. For example, if there is something that is not clearly defined in the UI, we can provide additional information to help users understand it.
* Help users get more out of New Relic (and increase our revenue). When users are able to use New Relic more effectively, they are more likely to renew their subscriptions and recommend us to others. This, in turn, helps us to make more money.

## FAQs

### When is onramps content needed?

Not every section of the UI requires an onramp. Use them primarily at a high level on the page. If the design calls for an onramp in a spot where you don't have much to say, then talk to the designer and/or PM for the section about modifying the design or removing the onramp.

### How should I name the onramp titles?

Titles (headers) can be any format, as long as they're short/succinct. For example, you can use an FAQ format where the headers are in question format. Here's the **Issues** tile onramp with titles formatted into questions.

<img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmOnrampsIssuesExample}
    style={{ maxWidth: '50%' }}
/>

If FAQ format is not applicable, use our standard headers for titles.

### How do I address different tile states?

A tile is something that's clickable and may contain data, depending on if customers have set it up. This is called an active vs. an empty state, and it's something to consider when writing onramps content. 

  * **Empty state**: If the tile has no data, it's an empty state, and if the user clicks on it, they may be directed to a setup page. 
    <img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmEmptyStateExample}
    style={{ maxWidth: '75%' }}
/>

  * **Active state**: If the has data, it's an active state, and our onramps content will want to help users interpret the data.
    <img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmActiveStateExample}
    style={{ maxWidth: '75%' }}
/>

In the examples above, regardless of what state the tile is in, the onramp is static, so it's important to contain information that's helpful for both states. Here's the onramp content for the **Service levels** tile.

 <img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmServiceLevelsExample}
    style={{ maxWidth: '75%' }}
/>


### How long should the content be?

If you're not using collapsers, **keep the character count under 1200** for the entire onramps section.

### Should I bold/italicize to emphasize something?

Since we can't add code formatting to onramps content, use bold and italics to emphasize something as needed.

### How much detail should I include?

If the onramps content isn't in the main place where the feature is (i.e., onramps content for the **Service levels** tile on the **APM Summary** page), then itâ€™s not the place to include a lot of detail.

### Should I add links to docs?

It's okay to add a link to docs for more details on something, but here are some considerations:
* Add a docs link if there's relevant information and it's too long to summarize/explain in onramps. 
* The onramps content will persist after the user clicks on something, so add a docs link if it's relevant to where the user might go next (i.e., if you click on the **Issues** tile and are taken to the **Issues** page, you'll still see the onramps popup on the same page, so you may want to learn how to configure issue thresholds on this page).

Avoid making a link to docs the sole content of an onramp.

When linking, use the established UI style for docs links. Use "See our docs" for the text.


### How should I reference UI navigation instructions?

 Let's say you want to direct users to something relevant in the UI and need to add navigation instructions. For example, if a user clicks on the **Issues** tile and they want to get alerts for issues (which is on another UI page), you can provide instructions in two ways:
 * Link them to the docs (i.e., "To create an alert condition, see [Create your first alert](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition/).")
 * Provide instructions directly to the UI page (i.e., "[Create an alert condition here](https://onenr.io/0kjnAlvY9Ro)).
