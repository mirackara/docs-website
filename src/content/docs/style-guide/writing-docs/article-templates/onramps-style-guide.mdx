Onramps content is information that appears our UI when a user clicks the **?** icon. This content is meant to be truncated and contextualized to where the user is and what they need to know to perform a task.

## How should I name the section titles?

When applicable, use an FAQ format where the headers are in question format.

For example, here's the Issues tile with headers formatted into questions.

<img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmOnrampsIssuesExample}
    style={{ maxWidth: '50%' }}
/>


If FAQ format is not applicable, use our standard headers for titles.

## What if a tile has two states (active and empty)?

A tile is something that's clickable and may or may not contain data, depending on if customers have set it up. This is called an active vs. an empty state, and it's something to consider when writing onramps content. If the tile has no data, it's in empty state, and if the user clicks on it, they may be directed to a set up page. If it has data, it's in active state, and our onramps content will want to help users interpret the data.

For example, here's the Service levels tile in active and empty states. The onramps content should contain info that's helpful for both states.

<img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={apmActiveEmptyState}
    style={{ maxWidth: '75%' }}
/>

## How long should the content be?

If you're not using collapsers, **keep the character count under 1200** for the entire onramps section.

## How should I bold/italicize to emphasize something?

Since we can't add code formatting to onramps content, use bold and italics to emphasize something as needed.

## How much detail should I include?

If the onramps content isn't in the main place where the feature is (i.e., onramps content for the Service levels tile on the APM Summary page), then itâ€™s not the place to include a lot of detail.

## Should I add links out to docs?

It's okay to add a link to docs "for more details" on something, but here are some considerations:
* Add a docs link if there's relevant information and it's too long to summarize/explain in onramps. 
* The onramps content will persist after the user clicks on something, so add a docs link if it's relevant to where the user might go next (i.e., if you click on the Issues tile and are taken to the **Issues** page, you'll still see the onramps popup on the same, so you may want to learn how to configure issue thresholds on this page).

## How should I reference UI navigation instructions?

 Let's say you want to direct users to something relevant in the UI and need to add navigation instructions. For example, if a user clicks on the Issues tile and they want to get alerts for issues (which is on another UI page), you can provide instructions in two ways:
 * Link them to the docs (i.e., "To create an alert condition, see [Create your first alert](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/your-first-nrql-condition/).")
 * Provide instructions directly to the UI page (i.e., "[Create an alert condition here](https://onenr.io/0kjnAlvY9Ro)).
