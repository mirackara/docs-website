If you're reviewing or composing UI installation routines, review these tips for maintaining consistency in your documentation.

## Stage labels [#stage-labels]

When you can, use active verbs in the stage labels so that users can see the actions they need to take. For example:

* Edit the configuration file
* Run the curl command

Repeat the stage labels as the first heading in the body.

## Requirements [#prerequisites]

When you're documenting requirements, here are some ways to reduce the friction for users:

* If the requirements are complex, create a separate stage called **Review requirements**.
* If the requirements are minimal, consider either leaving them out or inserting them into another stage, such as installation.
* If you need a separate section about requirements, use text like "We support most frameworks, but if...."
* Do not treat the infrastructure installation as a prerequisite&mdash;make it a complete stage.
* Avoid including any optional content (this includes products like Infinite Tracing).
