If you're reviewing or composing UI installation routines based on YAML files, follow these tips to keep your documents consistent and to speed up your work.

## Introductory information [#introductions]

Do not create introductory stages since users almost always know why they are interested in their choice of technology. For example, if you are migrating instructions from our docs site into the UI, leave out background and use-case material.

You can insert minimal introductory information into the heading, which is stored in the data source file. Keep in mind that you can't format the heading with Markdown, so keep it simple.

<img
    title="Screenshot showing the heading from the data source"
    alt="Screenshot showing the heading from the data source"
    src={styleguideDataSourceHeadingExample}
/>

If you must include some additional introductory material, insert it into another stage as supporting information.

## Stage labels [#stage-labels]

In the left margin that lists the stage steps, choose an active verb for the first word in the label. This helps users see the actions they need to take. For example, use active words like `Edit` and `Run`:

* Edit the configuration file
* Run the curl command

Repeat the stage labels as the first heading in the body:

<img
    title="Screenshot showing how to repeat the stage label"
    alt="Screenshot showing how to repeat the stage label"
    src={styleguideRepeatStageLabelinBody}
/>


## Requirements [#prerequisites]

When you're documenting requirements, here are some ways to reduce the friction for users:

* If the requirements are complex, create a separate stage called **Review requirements**.
* If the requirements are minimal, leave them out. If these minimal requirements are absolutely necessary, insert them into another stage, such as installation.
* If you need a separate requirements section, use text like `We support most frameworks. We don't support [INSERT_EXCEPTIONS]`.
* Do not treat the infrastructure installation as a prerequisite&mdash;make it a complete stage.
* Avoid including any optional content (this including optional configurations or products like Infinite Tracing).

## List [#lists]

The framework supports ordered (numbered) and unordered lists (bulleted lists).

### Ordered lists [#ordered-lists]

These are numbered lists that should start with active verbs in the steps.

The installation framework supports two types of ordered lists:

* Blue-circled numbered lists (created in YAML by `steps:`)
    <img
        title="Screenshot showing the blue-circled steps"
        alt="Screenshot showing the blue-circled steps"
        src={styleguideBlueCircledSteps}
    />
    * Use these for primary steps.
    * Nest any Markdown lists below them.
    * You can't insert any formatting in these list types.
* Markdown lists:
    * Use these for general lists prior to steps.
    * Use these as child lists below blue-circled ordered lists.

## View your data [#view-your-data]

The final stage of your installation routine tells users how to see their data.

* Make sure every install framework includes a separate **See your data** stage.
* Standardize the stage name with **See your [INSERT_NAME] data**. If the product name is too cumbersome, default to **See your data** which follows the same naming convention as the button.
* Repeat the stage name as the title in the main body.
* In the main pane, avoid stacked headings by including a preamble after the title. This can help readers understand the context and give them confidence about what is next (for example, "Now that you've completed the setup, you can see your data in the UI.")
* If your **See your data** section has blue-circled (non-Markdown) steps:
    * Use active verbs in the steps, such as **Open the...**.
    * Don't insert the button name (**See your data**) inside the step because you can't make it bold. Instead, in the blue-circled step, you can use an active verb and refer to the button indirectly. For example, "Click the button to see your data in the UI."
    * Since the **See your data** button sends the user away from the instructions, don't embed it in a step at the end or tack it at the bottom. In these cases, you may have to use future-looking language such as this: "After you've completed your configuration, you'll open the UI to view the data.
* If the **See your data** stage uses more than one type of option, figure out which one will give the user the biggest bang-for-the-buck and display that one. For example, maybe a NRQL query is the best way to show the results instead of opening a basic entity summary page.

  Do not link to quickstarts from anywhere in the installation stages&mdash;even if this is listed in the documentation as a prerequisite for viewing data.
