Image annotations are text and shapes in screen captures or diagrams that help to highlight information. We recommend avoiding the use of text inside a screenshot. Use [captions](/docs/style-guide/images/screenshots-images/#captions) instead.

If you need to use annotations:

* Be concise.
* Make sure annotations are easy to distinguish from UI text. For example, you may need to offset your boxes so they don't look like UI elements.
* Annotations aren't translated, so use them sparingly.
* Don't use an annotation at the top that acts like a title. Use a caption.
* Use our [New Relic SnagIt theme](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-doc-tools) (link only available to New Relic employees) to keep your annotations consistent. To import the New Relic theme:
  1. Open SnagIt.
  2. In the **Quick Styles** pane, select the **Theme** gear icon.
  3. Select **Import**.

## Callout boxes [#callout-boxes]

Callouts should be used to highlight the element being discussed in the documentation. Callouts should only be boxes, not lines or arrows. In general, there should be no text added to screenshots (that's what our documentation is for). Callout boxes should not obstruct any of the element they're calling out. For example, a callout box around a UI button should not cover any part of the button. If possible, a 2 pixel clearance should be given between the UI element and the callout box.

Because the UI uses flat objects with no objects with visual dimensionality and no drop shadows, our pages should also not use drop shadows for callouts.

Callout boxes format:

* Callout boxes: 4px border #00CE7C, transparent fill, no border radius.
* Font: Inter regular #017952, bold, left justified
* No shadows

Examples:

<img
  title="Example of a callout box"
  alt="Example of a callout box"
  src={styleguideExampleCalloutBox}
/>
