There are many ways to create videos, but here are some tips that will likely apply to many video production projects: 

* Before you start, talk to the Nerd Bytes team and make sure they're not working on a similar video. 
* For the most part, try to keep videos under two minutes. If your script is longer than that, consider breaking it up into more than one video. 
* You can use Camtasia to record your screen capture and voice-over audio. Tips for this: 
  * Record in a quiet room, using some sort of external microphone (for example, Apple headphones). Don't use the built-in computer microphone. 
  * Record several seconds of room tone (the sound of the empty room). This can be used to fill in gaps or cover up noises in the audio. This is better than using silence because going to complete silence can be jarring. 
  * You can easily take out pauses during editing: this means you can pause to prepare for the next sentence or section as long as you want.
  * Instead of reading the whole thing through multiple times, consider trying to read it once but, for sections you think weren't good, immediately repeat that section again. This can be easily than multiple entire-read takes. 
* You can use Camtasia to edit your video. Tips for this: 
  * Ensure your project is set to 100% scale. To do this, double click on your video on the timeline and then, in the upper right, make sure the scale reads 100%. When this is lower, it will export low-resolution video. 
  * To split a video for editing purposes, go to a location on the timeline and use Shift+Command+T. (This would be how you split the video to take out a pause, for example.)
  * Use the blur feature to blur sensitive information. Apply a blur effect and size it to the correct size, and then on the timeline arrange its start and end point at the appropriate location. 
  * When you're ready to export the video, go to **Share > Advanced export** and export it as an mp4.
