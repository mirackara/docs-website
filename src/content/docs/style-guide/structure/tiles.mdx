DocTiles, or just Tiles for short, are a unique type of react component designed to provide some visual flair to groups of links. Laid out in a grid, tiles can present a lot of links on a condensed space without overwhelming the reader. These are most useful for docs which direct to numerous places as part of their user journey, such as intro docs.

Tiles are set up similarly to Tabs, by placing the component using the following format where you want them to be in the doc. They are framed by `<DocTiles>` tabs, with each tile in the group being framed by `<DocTile>` tabs. The `DocTile path` section is where you place the hyperlink that you want the tile to lead to, and the `Text` section before the closing tag is where you put the text you want to display on the tile. You can add as many tiles as you want to a section, but try to limit them as best you can to avoid the component becoming overwhelming.

```
<DocTiles>
<DocTile path="">Text</DocTile>
<DocTile path="">Text</DocTile>
<DocTile path="">Text</DocTile>
</DocTiles>
```
