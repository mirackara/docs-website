When your site's front end lags, your customers are left waiting while you troubleshoot a problem that's as complex as your system. Often, your app's health depends on how well your database responds to queries, but pinpointing where exactly a database issue occurred can take time.

With New Relic, you can use our database UI to get the full context of your database performance over time, letting you pinpoint when a problem occurred so you can figure out what kind of solution you need. This tutorial explains how you can use New Relic metrics to troubleshoot and improve your slow queries. 

## Diagnose slow queries with NRQL [#nrql]

You can build NRQL queries that capture information about the response time speed of your database queries using the `Response time` metric. The NRQL statement creates a chart, which displays the average response time for one of your own database queries:

<SideBySide>
  <Side>
QUERY HERE  </Side>
  <Side>
CHART HERE   </Side>
</SideBySide>


## Get the full context, improve your performance [#fix]

Once you’ve identified a potential problem area, you can click through the chart to view a particular query group’s more granular details. We recommend taking these steps: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="compare-averages"
    title="Compare query time and throughput averages to a time window"
  >
 </Collapser>
<Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="break-down"
    title="Scope out the transaction calling your database"
  >
    INSERT_TEXT_HERE
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="bottlenecks"
    title="Find bottlenecks via a stack trace"
  >
    INSERT_TEXT_HERE
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
