Think about the last time you used an internal search that didn’t work. You probably expected a page to populate something related to your search, but as the site tried to process your query, it stuttered, lagged, or failed to display anything at all. What happened?

This tutorial guides you through the process of diagnosing a slow database so you can find the culprit behind slow queries. 

##Diagnose slow database queries

Your very first step is to have your database report ‘Response time’ metrics so you can see an overview of your site’s performance from our Database UI. Our UI has several charts that, taken together, provide a holistic overview of your database performance.

## Get the full context, improve your performance 

Once you’ve identified a potential problem area, you can click through the chart to view a particular query group’s more granular details. We recommend taking these steps: 

View the query time and throughput of the particular group, then compare to the average throughput and query time for a selected time window.
Break down the group by the transactions making the call to your database.
Find the stack trace of a particular database call, then check the code that executed that trace. Look for any bottlenecks in the query associated with this call.
Look at specific transactions within your database. 
Identify a database instance that performs a specific query
If your app is instrumented with an agent, you can look at query parameters to identify additional data issues
