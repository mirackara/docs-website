## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

* Understand service level indicators (SLIs) and service level obectives (SLOs).
* Have created and defined SLIs and SLOs for your front-end experience.
* Have alerts set up to warn of any SLI or SLO breaches so you can react before they impact your users.

## Intro 

Now that you've remdiated the root cause of your app's slowness, let's set up service levels so you can respond quickly if any slowness appears again. 

Let's look at the difference between service levels, SLOs and SLIs. Service levels describe services provided to users within a given period of time, in measurable terms. Service level objectives (SLOs) are the goals set for the availability expected out of a system. Service level indicators (SLIs) are the key measurements and metrics to determine the availability of a system. 

Defining and managing your service levels following the steps below provides the ability to: 

* Ease future setup: Automatically establish a baseline of performance and reliability for any service with a one-click setup.
* Define reliability across teams: Avoid arduous alignment processes with SLO and SLI recommendations that help you determine service boundaries. Set reliability benchmarks automatically based on recent performance metrics in any entity.
* Iterate and improve: With full-stack context and automation through open-source infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, teams have insight into how specific nodes or services impact system reliability and can quickly take control over their performance. Custom views for both service owners and business leaders drive operational efficiency and lead to better reporting, alerting, and incident management processes.
* Standardize reliability: Cross-organizational teams have a unified, transparent view of service reliability, and can better comply with customer-facing SLAs. SLO compliance metrics and error budgets give organizations a way to report on reliability and implement changes across applications, infrastructure, and teams in a cohesive fashion.

## Create performance benchmarks

Let's get started with creating your front-end performance benchmarks:

<Steps>
    <Step>

    ## Select service level indicators:

    While there are a large amount of SLIs you could use to define your front end experience benchmarks, the following are some we specifically reccomend. Each collapser has an explanation of when you should choose that SLI and a corresponding NRQL query (which you'll use in step 2).

    For now, just select one of the following:

    **SLIs for APM services instrumented with the New Relic agent**:
    Based on `Transaction` events, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services:

    <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="service-availability"
        title="Service success"
    >
        Service success is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. Effectively, this is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors.

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Transaction
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}'
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Bad events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: TransactionError
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND error.expected IS FALSE
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="service-latency"
        title="Service latency"
    >
        A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience.

        In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance.

        To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/), and use it to determine good events for your SLI:

        ```sql
        SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max
        ```

        **Valid events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Transaction
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND transactionType = 'Web'
        ```

        Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.

        **Good events fields**

        ```sql
        FROM: Transaction
        WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND transactionType = 'Web' AND duration < {duration}
        ```

        * Where `{entityGuid}` is the service's GUID.
        * Where `{duration}` is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds.
    </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    <Callout variant="tip">
    Your organization should define SLOs and SLIs based on your specific needs, your user's expectations, and resources available. After completing this tutorial, we recommend you [learn more about how to define granular custom service levels](/docs/service-level-management/create-slm/#define-user-exp).

    <img
    title="SLI ui"
    alt="An image of the service level maangement ui"
    src={sonicSliUiOverview}
    />

    1. Navigate to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Service levels management**. This UI shows all your service levels and allows you to define, monitor, and edit them. 
    2. Select **+ Add a service level** in the top right of the UI.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    Choose the corresponding entity that you want to create a service level for. This could be an entire workload, a specific service, a synthetic monitor, or even a specific transaction. Once you've selected your entity, click **Continue** on the left side of the UI pane.
    </Step>

    <Step>
 

    Define the SLI you chose in step one in this pane. For example if you chose to define an SLI for browser app success, you would use the following queries:

    **Query for valid events**:
    ```
    FROM: PageView
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}'
    ```

    **Query for bad events**:
    ```
    FROM: JavaScriptError
    WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND firstErrorInSession IS true
    ```

    Select **Continue** in the left pane once you've confirmed your queries are correct.
    </Step>
