When customers interact with your web apps, their activity creates routes through your code that begin when an app receives a web request and ends when a response is sent. How quickly these requests and responses are exchanged determines your app’s performance – if a page loads slowly, it’s likely something interrupted the route. 

These routes are transactions, which are a unit of work made up of function calls and method calls, like in HTTP requests or in SQL queries. Think about a critical business point, like a customer submitting payment on a purchase. If a customer reports that their payment either failed to process or processed after significant delay, you’re left guessing about the cause of that failure. Did an API cause the failure, or was it a recent bug fix deployed earlier that day? Our transactions UI helps you diagnose the source of a problem so you can improve the performance of specific transactions.

## Find slow transactions [#find-slow]

Our transactions UI helps you parse the different transactions that power your web app so you can identify the specific transaction that’s performing poorly. We found that when seeking out troublesome transactions, the Most Time Consuming and Slowest Average Response Time charts give the most useful information about your transaction speed.

    You can specify a time window and view all transactions with how long they took to receive and respond to a request in the Most Time Consuming  chart. Your busiest transactions appear at the top of the chart while your infrequently called transactions trend toward the bottom. By looking at your most frequently called transactions, you target the largest bulk of transactions in your app, leading to an overall improvement in general.

    Slowest Average Response averages the time from the total volume of a particular request. Using this average as a baseline, you can better diagnose whether a recent change in your code improved or degraded the overall performance of your web app.

## Get the full context, improve your performance [#fix]

You’ve identified what transactions may, on average, cause delays in your code, but knowing about an issue isn’t the same as finding a solution for your customers.

Once you’ve honed in on a problem transaction, you can find a breakdown of where in your code this particular route spends the most time.

1. Check the averages. If, on average, a route stalls in one part of your code, then start in that time window. 
2. Gather your slowest traces. While your slowest traces are outliers, they’re good indicators of what methods, databases, or HTTP calls have the biggest impact on your app’s performance.
3. Create a baseline with Historical performance, then compare it to your slowest trace. Your outliers are only as meaningful as your understanding of a route’s typical performance. 
4. If the issue relates to a Database, click the Database tab to extract observed queries. You’ll get a full view of stack trace and full query details.  

With all this context at your fingertips, you can now compare your app’s poor performance with your infrastructure metrics. Is it struggling with resources during this period? Is it related to something at the code-level? 

## Check your work 

You’ve scoped out the problem and found a potential solution. Push your fix to development, then run a typical load test to get a sense for how your app will run in production. 

As you monitor your response times, keep a close eye on your app’s transactions. 

* Are your transactions normal? You're done!
* Did they improve? Use what you've learned to figure out why they improved beyond normal. 
* Are you still seeing slow response times? Maybe there's a [database problem](/docs/journey-app-slow/slow-database-queries), or maybe your [external services]() are running slowly.
