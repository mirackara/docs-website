Your app is slow. Now what? How do you track down the root cause of your app's slowness?

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to triage your appliation and identify the root cause of your app's degraded performance. You'll start by "instrumenting" your app with an agent, which means installing a piece of code that reports data about your app to New Relic. Using this data in New Relic, you'll dig into the performance of your application and identify slow transactions, slow database queries, or slow external services as your issue - or possibly all three!

<Steps>

### Instrument your app

Before you can improve your site's performance, you need the ability to see what's going on. New Relic monitoring always starts with an **integration**, or a piece of code that collects data from a relevant technology and reports it to New Relic. To monitor your application's performance, you will use an agent created specifically for your app's language.

Click a logo to install an agent. This will send you to the New Relic platform where you will be guided through installing and configuring the agent.

### Navigate to application performance monitoring

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services** and select your app. . If you don't see much data just yet, step away for a while and let the agent gather real-time data as your application runs.
</Step>

<Step>
APM uses dozens of dashboards and charts, let's talk about what you should focus on first:

Look at the **Web transactions time** chart. This displays the average response time of certain metrics within your app. At a high level:
  * The blue line represents application code, sepcifially time spent in your application related to the code that isn't external or database calls..
  * The yellow segment represents time spent calling and waiting on database queries.
  * The green segment represents the time spent calling a HTTP service or endpoint. This could be a HTTP endpoint as part of the same app, another service as part of the same system, or it could be a completey external third party API. 

</Step>
<Step>
As your chart populates with data, take note of strange spikes in any line or segment. For example, regular spikes in the green segment could indicate your application might be under sporadic large loads from third party APIs. 

At the same time, take note of any segments or lines that consistantly take a large amount of time. While these may not be related to acute issues such as API overloads, they represent a great place to start optimizing your application. For example, if you notice your app's response time has a baseline of about 100ms, that indicates you could see strong performance improvments by optimizing code not related to external or database calls.
</Step>

Don't worry about fixing any issues or optimizing your code just yet. Use the information gathered above as a starting point for the rest of the steps in this tutorial. Feel free to move directly to the tutorial that covers your specific issues as identified above, but we recommend moving through the tutorials in order to optimize your code as effectively as possible:
