Your app is slow. Now what? How do you track down the root cause of your app's slowness?

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to triage your appliation and identify the root cause of your app's degraded performance. You'll start by "instrumenting" your app with an agent, which means installing a piece of code that reports data about your app to New Relic. Using this data in New Relic, you'll dig into the performance of your application and identify slow transactions, slow database queries, or slow external services as your issue - or possibly all three!

### Instrument your app

Before you can improve your site's performance, you need the ability to see what's going on. New Relic monitoring always starts with an **integration**, or a piece of code that collects data from a relevant technology and reports it to New Relic. To monitor your application's performance, you will use an agent created specifically for your app's language.

Click a logo to install an agent. This will send you to the New Relic platform where you will be guided through installing and configuring the agent.

### Navigate to application performance monitoring

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services** and select your app. This page will show an overwhelming amount of data and charts. If you don't see much data just yet, step away for a while and let the agent gather real-time data as your application runs.
