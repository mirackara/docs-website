Your app is slow. Now what? How do you track down the root cause of your app's slowness?

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to triage your application and identify the root cause of your app's degraded performance. You'll start by "instrumenting" your app with an agent, which means installing a piece of code that reports data about your app to New Relic. Using this data in New Relic, you'll dig into the performance of your application and identify slow transactions, slow database queries, or slow external services as your issue - or possibly all three!



## Prerequisite: instrument your app [#prereq]

Before you can improve your site's performance, you need the ability to see what's going on. New Relic monitoring always starts with an **integration**, or a piece of code that collects data from a relevant technology and reports it to New Relic. To monitor your application's performance, you will use an agent created specifically for your app's language.

Click a logo to install an agent. This will send you to the New Relic platform where you will be guided through installing and configuring the agent.

Once you've installed an agent, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core)** and select your app. If you don't see much data just yet, step away for a while and let the agent gather real-time data as your application runs.

## Identify optimization opportunities [#identify]

APM uses dozens of dashboards and charts. Let's talk about what you should focus on first:

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
Look at the **Web transactions time** chart. This chart displays the average response time of certain metrics within your app. As your chart populates with data, take note of strange spikes in any line or segment. At the same time, take note of any segments or lines that consistantly take a large amount of time. 
    </Side>
    <Side>
<img
  title="Default web transactions chart"
  alt="Default web transactions chart"
  src={journeyWebTrans}
/>
    </Side>
</SideBySide>


The tiles below explain what each segment represents and will take you to instructions on how to optimize them if you see any spikes or high load:

<DocTiles>
  <DocTile title='Blue line: application code' path="/docs/journey-app-slow/problematic-transactions" >The blue line represents application code, specifically time spent in your application related to the code that isn't external or database calls.</DocTile>
  <DocTile title='Yellow segment: database queries' path="/docs/journey-app-slow/slow-database-queries" >The yellow segment represents time spent calling and waiting on database queries. </DocTile>
  <DocTile title='Green segment: external services' path="/docs/journey-app-slow/external-services/" >The green segment represents the time spent calling a HTTP service or endpoint. This could be a HTTP endpoint as part of the same app, another service as part of the same system, or it could be a completey external third party API.</DocTile>
</DocTiles>
