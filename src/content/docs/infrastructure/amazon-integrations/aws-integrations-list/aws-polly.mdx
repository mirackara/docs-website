title: Amazon Polly monitoring integration
metaDescription: "The New Relic Amazon Polly integration: what data it reports, and how to enable it."
---

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for Amazon Polly that reports your Polly metrics to New Relic. 

## Features [#features]

With this integration, collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly) service. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Configuration and data transfer [#config-data-transfer]

We have two options for reporting data. We recommend using [streaming data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export) but [polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations) is also supported. 

[Default polling information](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) for AWS integrations:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

Data from this integration is attached to the `Metric` data type. To find this data in the UI: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter for `aws.polly`.

Alerts can be set up to notify you of breaking changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors:
