metaDescription: "New Relic's Amazon Polly integration: what data it reports, and how to enable it."
---

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) 
now include an integration for AWS Polly, sending its metrics data to New Relic 
observability platform. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your 
[AWS Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/) service
using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate]

- To [explore your integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data), go to 
**[one.newrelic.com/infra](https://one.newrelic.com/infra) > AWS > (select an integration)**.

## Configuration and data transfer

We recommend you to 
[stream data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export)
rather than use 
[polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations), 
though currently both options are supported. If you choose to use polling, it is possible to adjust polling frequency using \
[configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling information](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) for the 
AWS integrations:
- New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
- Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data

To find your integration data:

* For metrics: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.polly`

Alerts can be set up to notify you of breaking changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors:
