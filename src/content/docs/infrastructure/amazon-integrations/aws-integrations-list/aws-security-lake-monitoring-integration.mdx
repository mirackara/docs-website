---

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) 
now include an integration for AWS Security Lake, sending its metrics data to New Relic. 

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake/) using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration [#activate]

To enable this integration, see how to [connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Log forwarding [#forward-logs]

From our supported Amazon log forwarders, use [AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-logs-s3/). But instead of using the Lambda trigger, use SQS instead.

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

To find your logs on New Relic:

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs** and set **Attributes** to `product.name`, choose one or few of your interest.

The following source types of logs are currently supported:

* [ROUTE 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging-monitoring.html)
* [VPC FLOW](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html)
* [CLOUD TRAIL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html)
* [SECURITY HUB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)

## Set up alerts [#alerts]

You can set up alerts to notify you of breaking changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors.
