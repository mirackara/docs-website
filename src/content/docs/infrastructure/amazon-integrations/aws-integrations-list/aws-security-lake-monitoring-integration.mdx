[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) 
now include an integration for AWS Security Lake, sending its metrics data to New Relic 
observability platform. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your 
[Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake/)
using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration follow standard procedures 
to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure)

## Configuration and data transfer

From our supported Amazon log forwarders, [AWS Lambda for sending logs from 
S3](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-logs-s3/) is the one suitable for this case.
Just instead of Lambda trigger SQS could be used.

## Find and use data

To find your logs on New Relic side:

* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Logs** and set Attributes to `product.name`, choose one or few of 
your interest.

4 source types of logs are currently supported:
* [ROUTE 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging-monitoring.html)
* [VPC FLOW](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html)
* [CLOUD TRAIL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html)
* [SECURITY HUB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)
