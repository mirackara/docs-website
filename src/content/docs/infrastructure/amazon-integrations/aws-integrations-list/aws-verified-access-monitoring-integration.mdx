metaDescription: "New Relic's Amazon Verified Access integration: how to enable it, and what data it reports."
---

New Relic provides support for your AWS Verified Access logs. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data received and reported on.

For more information on setting up and using AWS Verified Access, see [Amazonâ€™s Verified Access documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verified-access/latest/ug/what-is-verified-access.html)

## Features [#about]

[AWS Verified Access](https://aws.amazon.com/verified-access/) is a tool that provides secure access to corporate applications without requiring a VPN.

Any time someone attempts to access your corporate application, a log is created, and they can be forwarded to New Relic via [AWS Kinesis Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/firehose/).

This integration monitors your Verified Access activity like top denied IP Addresses, overall count of denied & granted activity, etc.

## Activate Verified Access integration [#activate-integration]

This integration is set up in your AWS console. 

<Callout variant="important">
To use Kinesis Firehose, you must have a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream already created. If you do not, you can create one by going to Amazon Kinesis Firehose feature from your AWS console [https://console.aws.amazon.com/firehose/], and creating a delivery stream with `Destination: New Relic`.

Find out more about creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html?icmpid=docs_console_unmapped]
</Callout>

1.	From your AWS console, navigate to the [AWS VPC Service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc)
2.	From the left panel, under the AWS Verified Access dropdown, select `Verified Access instances`
3.	Select the ID of the instance you would like to configure
4.	Select the `Verified Access instance logging configuration` tab
5.	Select `Modify Verified Access instance logging configuration`
6.	Select the `Deliver to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose` toggle
7.	Select a Delivery stream configured to point to New Relic


## Find and use data [#find-data]

You can [query and explore your data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data/) in the logs explorer, filtering by `metadata.product.name = Verified Access`

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand and use integration data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data/)

This table describes the data from Verified Access Logs. For example logs check out the [AWS Verified Access log examples doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verified-access/latest/ug/verified-access-logs-examples.html).
