Install New Relic's infrastructure agent on your AWS instances in a single click through our integration for AWS System Manager Distributor. This document explains the integrations features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features
Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from diverse AWS instances through a single click. New Relic's AWS System Manager Distributor integration installs our infrastrucutre agent on your AWS instances to allow you to quickly monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance. 

## Activate integration

To install the New Relic infrastructure agent through AWS System Manager Distributor:

1. Place your [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/) in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Specify `/newrelic-infra/license` as `Name` in the parameter field and choose the `SecureString` option in `Type`. Place your key in `Value` field.
2. From the [IAMV console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles) create a role utilizing `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy.
3. If the AMI being used for the instance(s) does not have AWS CLI agent preinstalled, install it manually:
  ```
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-{x86_64|aarch64}.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
  unzip awscliv2.zip
  sudo ./aws/install
  ```
4. If the AMI does not have SSM agent preinstalled, install it manually or via a template:
  ```
  sudo yum install -y https://s3.<var>{region}</var>.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-<var>{region}</var>/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
  ```
5. On the Systems Manager interface select **Third party** and select the **New-Relic-infrastructure-monitoring-agent** tile.
6. Choose your preffered installation, then select **Run a command** and in the **Targets** pane click **Choose instances manually**. Select all the instances you want to monitor and then click **Run**.

1. Generate some traffic for your AWS instance, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic.
2. Explore your app's data in the [our UI](one.newrelic.com).

## Configuration and polling 

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

- New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
- Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes


## Find and use data
