metaDescription: "New Relic's Amazon NAT Gateway integration: Use AWS CloudWatch Metrics to monitor your NAT Gateway performance"
---

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) 
now include an integration for AWS NAT Gateway, sending its metrics data to New Relic 
observability platform. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported.

## Features

Collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your 
[NATGateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html)
using our integration. Monitor your services, query incoming data, and build dashboards to observe everything at a glance.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration follow standard procedures 
to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).


## Configuration and data transfer

We recommend that you
[stream data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export)
rather than use 
[polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations), 
though currently both options are supported. If you choose to use polling, it is possible to adjust polling frequency using \
[configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling information](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) for the 
AWS integrations:
- New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
- Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute or 5 minutes

## Find and use data

To find your integration data:

* For metrics: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.natgateway`
