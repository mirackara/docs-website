metaDescription: Install our Lighttptd dashboards and see your Lighttptd  data in New Relic.
---

Your Lighttpd web server transmits outcome measures and inventory data to the New Relic system via our Lighttpd integration with Nri-Flex setup. Metric data can be seen on our pre-built dashboards, and you can also create your own custom searches, graphs, and alert policies.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your app's performance. The version should be 1.10.7 or later to support NRI-Flex integration.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways:

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview).
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/).


## Integrate Lighttpd with New Relic [#integrate]

Once installed, the infrastructure agent can ingest data from your app and send it to New Relic, but you still need to integrate – or establish a line of communication – between the agent and your app. Once integrated, you can get started with an out of the box monitoring solution for your Lighttpd app. 



## See Lighttpd metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

With only the infrastructure agent installed and instrumented with your app, you can view your raw data in our Metrics & events. Our default dashboards transform that raw data into charts and graphs, which provide a bird's eye view of your system's health. To install our default dashboards, go to our Lighttpd instant observability page.
