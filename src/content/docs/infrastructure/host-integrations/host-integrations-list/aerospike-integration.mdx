After setting up our LAMPy integration, we give you a dashboard for your LAMPy web app metrics.

## Install [#install]

### Step 1 (optional): Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

Installing the infrastructure agent is optional, but doing this will get you important metrics about the host where your app is running. 

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for the host containing your Flutter app.

### Step 2: Install nri-aerospike application [#aerospike]

The prometheus exporter application named nri-aerospike is available on the apt-get repository. 

To install nri-aerospike, use the below command:

```
sudo apt-get install nri-aerospike
```
On successful installation, you will see

1. Exporter is installed in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin directory
2. a sample configuration file is created in /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d directory
3. Rename the sample configuration file “aerospike-config.yml.sample” to “aerospike-config.yml”

Your configuration file should look like this

```
integrations:
    - name: nri-aerospike
      config:
        # API URL of the aerospike service
        aerospike_db_host: localhost
        aerospike_db_port: 3000

        # Port to expose scrape endpoint on, If this is not provided a random port will be used to launch the exporter
        exporter_port: 9145

        # Cluster name is used on the aerospike.prometheus.json.template - all the metrics captured by nri-prometheus will be categorised under this cluster name
        aerospike_cluster_name: YOUR_DESIRED_CLUSTER_NAME
        scrape_timeout: 5s

        label_type: development
        label_source: aerospike

        exporter_files_path: /tmp

        # transformations:
        #   - description: "General processing rules"
        #     ignore_metrics:
        #     - prefixes:
        #       - "go_"
        #       - "process_"

```

On successful configuration, you should be able to see the list of aerospike metrics on `http://localhost:9145/metrics`
Follow the [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart the New Relic infra agent

## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your Aerospike dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `Aerospike`. 
4. The Aerospike dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Aerospike dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

This integration reports data in the form of our [browser monitoring events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-browser-monitoring). If you installed the infrastructure agent, you'll also receive [infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here is an example NRQL query to check bytes sent per request:

```
SELECT (average(`apache.server.net.bytesPerSecond`) 
AVERAGE (`apache.server.net.requestsPerSecond`)) 
AS 'Bytes sent per request' 
FROM Metric 
TIMESERIES auto
```
