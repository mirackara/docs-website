Maintaining a website is the combined effort of multiple teams. When a site outage affects a developer or engineering team's KPIs, they can identify and resolve the issue with direct access to the frontend or backend. A digital marketer has a different situation. Your team's success is just as dependent on site performance, but you might face obstacles to addressing any issue yourselves.

Our website performance monitoring (WPM) tool can give you developer-grade insight about your website. This doc helps you set up and understand your data, so you can empower your team to take control of your customer experience. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

In this tutorial, you will:

* Set up monitoring for two pages with website performance monitoring 
* Learn about the data collected from WPM

## Set up WPM [#setup]
<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Get data without installation

    Accessing website performance monitoring requires at least one URL. After pasting it in, New Relic deploys a series of monitors from different servers around the globe. Each monitor runs a scheduled check for website availability, broken links, and SSL certificate expiration. 

    To get to website performance monitoring, go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Choose your URL 

    Your very first step to using WPM is choosing a page. WPM doesn't monitor your entire site, only individual pages that you've chosen. We recommend choosing these pages:

    * Your homepage.
    * Pages with critical assets, like important videos, images, or links.
    * Pages critical to your customer funnel

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Paste in URL

<img
    title="Insert your URL"
    src={step1WpmStep1}
/>

WPM requires no installation or set up. Once you've chosen your page, paste in the URL. New Relic will take a few minutes to deploy our monitors, then you'll start receiving data about your website. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add Google PageSpeed API key 

When you set up WPM for the first time, New Relic generates some of your **Core Web Vitals** metrics via Google PageSpeed. To receive continuous data about your app, you need to set up PageSpeed with your own account.

<img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={pagespeedWPMPageSpeed}
/>

    </Step>
</Steps>

Once your monitors report data to New Relic, your WPM page displays metrics that can help you improve user experience. WPM gives you four kinds of data:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="ping"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
<img
    title="View your page availability"
    alt="View page availability"
    src={pingWPM}
/>

The first section of WPM shows you ping data. This kind of data is an availability check, confirming basic site functionalities:

* **Site availability**. This reports whether your page has loaded at all. If it hasn't, there might be an issue with your servers or domain.
* **Page load time**. This collects the median speed for how long it takes your page to load all of its assets. This data gets further broken down later on.
* **SSL Validity**. This tells you whether your SSL certificate is valid, expiring, or expired. It'll include the date you need to renew your SSL certificate as well.
* **Broken links**. After testing all the links on your page, it'll report back which links are broken. 

Because of how WPM collects data, these checks update as often as you've configured your deployment intervals. If something changes between the times you've manually checked your page, your monitors will report that change and alert you.

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="core-web-vitals"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
<img
    title="View your core web vitals data"
    alt="View your core web vitals data"
    src={cwvWPM}
/>

Google PageSpeed reports your core web vitals alongside other metrics collected by New Relic. This data gives you insight into how users experience your site. 

* **First contentful paint**. This captures the time it takes for the first asset to load on a page. In the above screenshot, it took the site 3.22s for something to load on the page. 
* **Largest contentful paint**. Unlike first contentful paint, this captures the time taken for the main content on the page to fully load. For example, if information about an important campaign appears in a page's main asset, then this number tells us how long a user waits before seeing it. In the above screenshot, it took 2.79s. 
* **First input delay**. When a user interacts with an element on your site, it takes time to process the user's interaction This number captures that time as a delay between the request (user interaction) and response (how the page changes based on the user request).
* **Cumulative layout shift**. This measures visual stability of different assets on your site. For example, after a user goes to your site's main page, images may shift while loading. This movement is unanticipated.

<img
    title="Adjust timeslice data"
    alt="Adjust timeslice data"
    src={timeWPM}
/>

New Relic contextualizes this data over time. You can click and drag over relevant parts of this chart, which gives you more granular insight about site behavior. When you're finished, click the time stamp button at the top to adjust back to your preferred time period. 

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="content"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
<img
    title="Analyze content size"
    alt="Analyze content size"
    src={contentWPM}
/>

If page load speed is slow, then you can use the **Content** section to diagnose potential sources of the problem relative to each other. For example, comparing **Content size** to **Content load time** can give insight into whether CSS is taking up too many resources and loading last, which would cause a delay in largest contentful paint. 

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="geo"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >

Your WPM data is collected by a set of monitors deployed from different servers around the world, allowing you to test how users from different areas around the world experience your site.

</CollapserGroup>

## Improve your customer experience [#improve]

If a website grader provides a snapshot of your data, then you can think of developer-grade data as a video. All WPM data measures a certain site capability, component, or behavior against time. It tells you two things:

* How long it takes a site functionality to respond to a request.
* How your current site compares to previously collected data.

## Fix broken links that disrupt user journeys [#broken-links]

Unlike a website grader, WPM lets you view your critical pages in context of each other. If user engagement is down but your site is available and content is optimized, then something else might be at play. With WPM, your monitors routinely ping your chosen pages and report back. A possible journey to troubleshoot might look like:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**.
2. You check the availability of your page. It reads as available. 
3. Your core web vitals are reporting as **Good** across the board.
4. You notice the timeslice data shows a steep drop-off in traffic the day before, around the time updates to your landing page were made.
5. On the WPM page for your landing page, you see a broken link has been reported. It's a boilerplate banner that's used across other areas of your site.

At this point, you can coordinate with the relevant teams to fix the broken link and deploy an update for the rest of the site. 

## Optimize your campaign page assets [#optimize]

WPM lets you visualize how different types of assets perform relative to each other. In the **Core web vitals** section, you can view four bar graphs that show your content's size, load time, their resources, and how the network affects them. Using two or more of these graphs can help you identify if, say, your CSS assets are causing load issues.
