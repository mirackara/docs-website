Maintaining a website combines the effort of multiple teams. When outages happen, developer and engineering teams have access to resolve the issue directly, but a digital marketer has a different situation. While your team's success is just as dependent on site performance, you might not have the tools to identify or address any issue yourselves.

Our website performance monitoring (WPM) tool gives you insight about your site's availability and performance. With out of the box alerts and routine checks from our monitors, you'll never be in the dark about user experience.

    Once data has been collected, you'll be able to view different charts that track user details about your page's assets. Taken together, they can help you understand how your users experience your site.

## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc helps you set up and understand your data, so you can empower your team to take control of your customer experience. In this tutorial, you will:

* Set up monitoring for two pages with website performance monitoring 
* Learn about the data collected from WPM

## Set up WPM [#setup]
<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Get data without an installation

    WPM requires no installation or setup. To access WPM, go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Choose your URL 

    Once you've chosen pages to monitor, New Relic deploys a set of monitors from different servers around the globe that check each page for website availability, broken links, performance, and SSL certificate expiration. To get started, we recommend choosing these pages:

    * Your homepage.
    * Pages with critical assets, like important videos, images, or links.
    * Pages critical to your customer funnel

New Relic will take a few minutes to deploy the monitors, then you'll start receiving data about your website. Keep in mind that WPM doesn't check all pages across your site, only the ones you've manually added.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add Google PageSpeed API key 

When you set up WPM for the first time, New Relic gives you complementary core web vitals via Google PageSpeed. To continue receiving your core web vitals, you need to input your [Google PageSpeed API key](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started) into New Relic via the guided flow in WPM's UI.

    src={pageSpeedAPI}

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Put your data in context

Once your monitors report data to New Relic, your WPM page displays metrics that can help you improve user experience. WPM gives you four kinds of data:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="ping"
        title="Check page availability"
    >
<img
    title="View your page availability"
    alt="View page availability"
    src={pingWPM}
/>

The first section of WPM shows you ping data. This kind of data is an availability check, confirming basic site functionalities:

* **Site availability**. This reports whether your page has loaded at all. If it hasn't, there might be an issue with your servers or domain.
* **Page load time**. This collects the median speed for how long it takes your page to load all of its assets. This data gets further broken down by content type and size.
* **SSL Validity**. This tells you whether your SSL certificate is valid, expiring, or expired. It'll include the date you need to renew your SSL certificate as well.
* **Broken links**. After testing all the links on your page, it'll report back which links are broken. 

WPM collects data by capturing site behavior via monitors that interact with your site. This lets you see updated data on a day-to-day basis so you never have to guess when assets or pages fail to load.

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="core-web-vitals"
        title="Track user experience"
    >
<img
    title="View your core web vitals data"
    alt="View your core web vitals data"
    src={cwvWPM}
/>

Google PageSpeed reports your core web vitals alongside other metrics collected by New Relic. This data gives you insight into how users experience your site. 

* **First contentful paint**. This captures the time it takes for the first asset to load on a page. In the above screenshot, it took the site 3.22s for something to load on the page. 
* **Largest contentful paint**. Unlike first contentful paint, this captures the time taken for the main content on the page to fully load. For example, if information about an important campaign appears in a page's main asset, then this number tells us how long a user waits before seeing it. In the above screenshot, it took 2.79s. 
* **First input delay**. When a user interacts with an element on your site, it takes time to process the user's interaction This number captures that time as a delay between the request (user interaction) and response (how the page changes based on the user request).
* **Cumulative layout shift**. This measures visual stability of different assets on your site. For example, after a user goes to your site's main page, images may shift while loading. This movement is unanticipated.

<img
    title="Adjust timeslice data"
    alt="Adjust timeslice data"
    src={timeWPM}
/>

New Relic contextualizes this data over time. You can click and drag over relevant parts of this chart, which gives you more granular insight about site behavior. When you're finished, click the time stamp button at the top to adjust back to your preferred time period. 

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="content"
        title="Compare content size, load times, and sources"
    >
<img
    title="Analyze content size"
    alt="Analyze content size"
    src={contentWPM}
/>

WPM lets you visualize how different types of assets perform relative to each other. In the **Core web vitals** section, you can view four bar graphs that show your content's size, load time, their resources, and how the network affects them. Using two or more of these graphs can help you identify if, say, your CSS assets are causing load issues. 

If page load speed is slow, then you can use the **Content** section to diagnose potential sources of the problem relative to each other. For example, comparing **Content size** to **Content load time** can give insight into whether CSS is taking up too many resources and loading last, which would cause a delay in largest contentful paint. 

    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="geo"
        title="Fix broken links"
    >

Unlike a website grader, WPM lets you view your critical pages in context of each other. If user engagement is down but your site is available and content is optimized, then something else might be at play. With WPM, your monitors routinely ping your chosen pages and report back. A possible journey to troubleshoot might look like:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**.
2. Check the availability of your page. It reads as available. 
3. Your core web vitals are reporting as **Good** across the board.
4. You notice the timeslice data shows a steep drop-off in traffic the day before, around the time updates to your landing page were made.
5. WPM shows that a broken link has been reported. It's a boilerplate banner that's used across other areas of your site.

At this point, you can coordinate with the relevant teams to fix the broken link and deploy an update for the rest of the site. 

    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## What's next? [#next]

WPM is designed to simplify getting detailed insight about your site. But you can use New Relic to collect data about real user traffic or key user flows. Depending on your organization's structure, you might need to loop in your developer team to set these up. We recommend you start with these features: 

* [Create a codeless step monitor](https://one.newrelic.com/synthetics/monitor-create) that mimics a user journey through your site, such as adding an item, logging in, or filling out a form. If you're uncertain, check out our tutorial on [how to create a step monitor](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/#step).
* You can [add a Javascript snippet](https://onenr.io/0gR76llakwo) to your code to start tracking real user data with our browser agent. 
* Want to learn more about how New Relic can improve your website? We have a tutorial about [improving your website's performance](/docs/journey-performance/improve-website-performance).
