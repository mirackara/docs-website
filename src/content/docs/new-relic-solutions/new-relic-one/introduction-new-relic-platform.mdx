Now that you've [created a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup), and [installed some observability tools](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-intro), you probably want some tips for getting around the platform. 

To access New Relic, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**. If you have an EU datacenter account, go to **[one.eu.newrelic.com](https://one.eu.newrelic.com)**.

Below is a 15 minute video that covers some of the more important New Relic experiences. Note that this video shows how a [full platform user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) would experience the platform.

Below are some details about the topics covered in the video, and links to related docs.

## Capabilities [#capabilities]

If you're new to using New Relic, you may want to customize your left-side menu. To do that, go to the [**All capabilities** page](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) to find our core features and experiences. You can then pin the capabilities you think you'll often be using. 

<img
  title="New Relic all capabilities page gif"
  alt="A gif showing how to pin New Relic capabilities."
  src={transtionGuideUiRedesignCustomize}
/>

## Account switcher [#account-switcher]

<img
  title="New Relic account switcher"
  alt="New Relic account switcher"
  src={accountSwitcherWide}
/>

Some [New Relic organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) have more than one account. The account switcher in the top right shows you which account you're in and lets you switch between them. By default, we show you all the accounts you have access to in your organization. 

## Explore your system [#explore]

<img
  title="New Relic entity explorer"
  alt="New Relic entity explorer"
  src={entityExplorer}
/>
<figcaption>
  The **List**, **Navigator**, and **Lookout** views help you quickly understand what's going on with your entire system. 
</figcaption>

To get a sense of how your entire system is doing, click **All entities**. We use the term `entity` to refer to something that New Relic monitors, whether that's an application, a host, a database service, or something else. We also use it to refer to a component that contains New Relic data, such as a New Relic custom dashboard or a workload. For more on this concept, see [Entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic). 

When you click **All entities**, you're in what we call the **Entity explorer** view, also know as the **Entity list** view. See how **List** is selected in the upper right? 

The list view shows you a synopsis of all the things you're monitoring, broken up into categories ([learn about these categories](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/#find)). If you have many monitored entities, it may show you only a few in each category, with a priority on those that have had alerting violations. For any category, you can click **View all** to see more entities in that category. 

Note you can also scroll up and down the left-side entity category menu, as another way to browse all the things you monitor. 

Where it says **List** in the top right, you can also switch to the **Navigator** and **Lookout** experiences, which are also helpful for understanding your entire system at a glance. 

<img
  title="New Relic Navigator"
  alt="New Relic Navigator"
  src={navigator}
/>

New Relic Navigator is meant to give you a more visual overview of your system based on alerting status. Hover over various entities to see more detail about their status. [Learn more about Navigator.](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/#view-navigator)

<img
  title="New Relic Lookout"
  alt="New Relic Lookout"
  src={lookout}
/>

We also have New Relic Lookout, which is another visual way to quickly see how your whole system is doing. This is focused on changes in performances: it draws your attention to entities that have undergone significant shifts in important metrics. [Learn more about Lookout.](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/#view-lookout)

## Help [#help]

If you ever want help for a New Relic UI experience, just go up to the top of the page and click the `?` icon. That will show you some docs about the specific UI experience you're in.  

## Search [#search]

<img
  title="New Relic platform search"
  alt="New Relic platform search"
  src={search}
/>

New Relic also has a powerful search functionality. To search, click **Search** on the left. Whatever you search for, it'll show you where that word appears in different places, such as in your monitored services, in your monitored hosts, in your custom dashboards, and more. The more stuff you're monitoring with New Relic, the more you'll likely be using the search button. For more about how search works, see [Search](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/#search).

## Chart options [#charts]

<img
  title="New Relic chart options"
  alt="New Relic chart options"
  src={chartOptions}
/>

All New Relic charts have various options available, including options for sharing with teammates, options for creating alerts for the metric shown in a chart, and options for seeing and editing a chart's underlying query. [Learn more about chart options.](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features)

## Understanding connections [#connections]

One of the most powerful aspects of New Relic is how it lets you tie together all the components in your system and understand how they're connected. Let's look at a few features related to that. 

### Distributed tracing [#tracing]

Distributed tracing is powerful for helping you dig down into a specific kind of transaction and see the various calls and components involved in that activity. For more on using this feature, see [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui). 

There are a few ways to get to distributed tracing: 

* For global distributed tracing, go to: **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Traces**. This shows you traces from across your accounts and entities. 
* Entity-specific tracing. You can also go to a specific monitored entity (for example, an APM-monitored app) and click **Distributed tracing** there. That shows you traces that involve that specific entity.

  title="Distributed tracing trace waterfall"
  alt="Distributed tracing trace waterfall"
  src={traceWaterfall}
/>
### Service maps [#maps]

When you're in the UI for a specific monitored entity, you can click **Service map** to see a visual map of how that service relates to other monitored entities. For more details, see [Service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps).

<img
  title="APM service map"
  alt="APM service map"
  src={serviceMap}
/>

### Workloads [#workloads]

Our [workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster) feature lets you group together related entities in ways that make sense to your business. This becomes more and more important the bigger your organization is. Here's one of the UI pages you can find in a workload: a map showing the workload entities. 

<img
  title="Workload map"
  alt="Workload map"
  src={workloadMap}
/>

## Query your data [#query]

<img
  title="nrql_example.png"
  alt="nrql_example.png"
  src={queriesnrqlNrqlExampleTimeseries}
/>

Learning how to query your data will help you get the most out of New Relic. We give you a lot of out-of-the-box UI experiences, but to optimize your observability endeavors you'll likely want to bring in some custom data and make some custom dashboards. 

Our query builder uses NRQL: New Relic query language. You don't have to learn NRQL yet. Once you're feeling comfortable with New Relic and are ready to unlock more of its power, you can start exploring [our NRQL docs](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

You can also explore your data without needed to know NRQL. Go to the [**Metrics and events** explorer](https://one.newrelic.com/data-explorer) to get a visual interface for understanding your data. 

## Account settings [#admin]

<img
  title="the location of the New Relic user menu"
  alt="the location of the New Relic user menu"
  src={accountsUserMenuLocation}
/>

In the lower left corner, you've got your user menu, which gives you access to more administrative options, including options for managing your data and your users. For docs on the options available there, see [Account settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings).

## News and updates [#whats-new]

Also, near the user menu, where it says **Help**, you can access our [**What's new?** posts](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new). These are announcements about exciting new features and important changes.
