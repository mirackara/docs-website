Why should I test my data once the transfer is complete?
What is needed to test the data? 
Where do I go in NR to test the data?
How do I test the transfer?
Where do I go from here once I'm done?

Possibly the most important single part of the series is “where do I go from here?”. We want the user to feel empowered to take on new challenges with NR that only our product can do, so we will need to make sure we don’t send them into a brick wall. Perhaps linking to “improving website performance using NR” is a good starting point.
Do we need to make any further mention of DD in this article? Sounds like something we should consult with marketing or competitive for.
