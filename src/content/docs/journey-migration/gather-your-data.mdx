import journeyAbnormalLCP from 'images/browser_screenshot-crop_LCP-abnormal.png'

Why do I need to gather anything before moving (as opposed to just “starting over” with New Relic)?
What do I need to ensure I have before moving to New Relic?
Where do I get what I need from my system, apps, or DataDog?
How do I gather what is needed?

Customer is assumed to have done no legwork prior to this step. Customer should end this step with everything from their system and ideally some way to ensure they have everything (say a checklist)
This topic is expected to be short but shouldn't be neglected compared to other longer steps
