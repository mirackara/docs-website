Log observability is essential to both understanding and using your data to the fullest. We believe log observability should be easy to manage, easy to access, and easy to scale. New Relic lets you ingest any text-based data from any source, letting you easily manage large quantities of your data in one place. And just like infrastructure and application monitoring, you can do it all [for free](https://newrelic.com/signup).

## Your log monitoring solution 

Logs in the New Relic UI are found under the **Logs** section, exactly like you're used to in Datadog. New Relic log monitoring makes getting what you need from your logs as easy as possible, helping you avoid the headache that comes from parsing massive amounts of data. Our log monitoring solution:

* Enables deep visibility into your infrastructure and application data.
* Helps reduce your mean time to resolution (MTTR).
* Gives you the ability to create curated charts, dashboards, and alerts.
* Provides the ability to visualize, search, and troubleshoot performance issues in one central location without the need to switch between tools.
