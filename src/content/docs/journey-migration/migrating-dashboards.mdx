Setting up monitors for your data is essential for observability, but it's only half of the equation. You need to be able to visualize your data, group data points together, and be notified when your system runs into issues. You need to be able to do all this from a centralized location, and be able to adapt to the changing data needs of your organization by creating new visualizations on-the-fly. 

Where New Relic entities can give you scores of data sources to observe, our dashboards and alerts come in to help you make the most of it. You can use our pre-configured options to set up solutions, or use [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/), New Relic's Query Language, to create custom dashboard components and alert policies that are as fine-tuned to your requirements as you need. And like all our other features, you can try out dashboards and alerts using your own data [for free](https://newrelic.com/signup).

## Your dashboarding solution [#dashboard-solutions]

Our dashboards take the data you put into New Relic and arrange them visually exactly how you want them to appear. You can make them as broad or as detailed as you like, and use them to troubleshoot issues before they become problems. Our dashboards give you:

* Analysis into your system, letting you correlate issues and act on them fast
* In-depth views of your network, infrastructure, applications, logs, and anything else you need
* Eliminate data silos and view your entire stack at a glance
* Report on custom information from virtually any data source

        Go to [**one.newrelic.com > Add Data**](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace), then select an integration. For this example, we'll choose **Infrastructure & OS**, and create a dashboard to monitor an Azure integration.  
        </Step>
        <Step>
        Select the **Azure Integrations Data Ingest Analysis** option under **Dashboards** to open the guided install window.
        </Step>
        <Step>
        From the drop-down, select an account.
        </Step>
        <Step>
        If you haven't installed your integration yet, choose **Setup**. If you installed already, choose **Done**.
        </Step>
        <Step>
        New Relic creates the dashboard, and you can select **View dashboard** to go to it right away and begin visualizing your data stream.

## Your alerting solution [#alerts-solutions]

Being able to see your data is great, but being able to act on it to correct or prevent errors is even better! New Relic gives you multiple ways to customize alerts for your unique requirements while helping to eliminate alert fatigue. An alert will notify you of an issue before it becomes a problem, using machine learning and applied intelligence to enhance our policies. Here's what sets our alerts apart:

* Get started quickly with preconfigured alerts, or go deeper and create them from scratch using NRQL (New Relic's Query Language)
* Constantly detect the anomalies you care about the most
* Notify the right people at the right time, eliminating confusion in dealing with issues
* Prioritize alert importance, reducing clutter and helping you keep track of what's really important
