Intro - "Now that you've instrumented monitoring for infrastructure, applications, and logs, you can create dashboards and alerts to help you see the data you need when you need to see it."

Talk about the power of alerts and the flexibility of dashboards. Enforce that you can customize both to get what you need from your data without having to constantly search for things. Push convenience and ease of use once set up.

* We offer customers multiple methods to enhance alerts while reducing alert fatigue. New Relic’s alerting allows customers to address dynamic abnormalities with an out-of-the-box guided alert setup.
* New Relic provides a proactive issue awareness solution that leverages AI and ML capabilities to provide continuous,automatic anomaly detection as part of the core platform.
