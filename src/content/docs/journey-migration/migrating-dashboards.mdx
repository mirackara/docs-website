Setting up monitors for your data is the foundation of observability, but it's only half of the equation. You need to be able to visualize your data, group streams together, and be notified when your system runs into issues that negatively affect your users. You need to be able to do all this from a centralized location, and be able to adapt to the changing data needs of your organization by curating new visualizations on-the-fly. 

Where New Relic entities can give you the data you need, New Relic dashboards and alerts come in to help you make the most of it. Our dashboards are quick to set up without losing the finer details on your data, and our alerts can be customized to notify you of nearly any situation you can imagine. 

* We offer customers multiple methods to enhance alerts while reducing alert fatigue. New Relic’s alerting allows customers to address dynamic abnormalities with an out-of-the-box guided alert setup.
* New Relic provides a proactive issue awareness solution that leverages AI and ML capabilities to provide continuous,automatic anomaly detection as part of the core platform.
