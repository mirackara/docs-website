While setting up infrastructure monitoring provides a great foundation for understanding your systems, the best way to truly know your data comes from monitoring application performance. New Relic APM provides extensive, unified monitoring for all your applications. 

That means we can better link your data through your apps and integrations, and provide more focused information for you through curated dashboards. That way, you get the level of depth and detail you need without having to hunt for what you want. And you can try out our extensive APM capabilities absolutely free.

## Your APM solution

You may be used to `integrations` in Datadog, but in New Relic, we call these capabilities APM `agents`. We've set up our agents for both convenience and functionality. Our agents let you:

* Monitor the performance and health of your apps in one central location.
* User New Relic with open source tools such as OpenTelemetry.
* Automatically instrument metrics, events, and traces.
* Ingest your logs automatically.
* Manage service security without prior configuration.

## Get started with New Relic APM monitoring
Once the setup is complete, your APM data in New Relic is found in the **APM and services** section of the UI, which is the equivalent of the **APM** section in Datadog. You can follow a guided install for most of our agents at any time within [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com) by selecting **Add Data > All > Guided install**, then selecting your agent from the **APM (Application Monitoring)** section.

You can also install our APM agents directly by using any of the tiles below. Our guided installs walk you through the setup procedures for any of our APM agents so that you can observe your data right away. All you need is a [free account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and an application to monitor and you're ready to begin!
