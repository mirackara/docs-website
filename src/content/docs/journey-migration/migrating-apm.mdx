While setting up infrastructure monitoring provides a great foundation for understanding your systems, the best way to truly know your data comes from monitoring application performance. New Relic APM provides extensive, unified monitoring for all your applications. 

That means we can better link your data through your apps and integrations, and provide more focused information for you through curated dashboards. That way, you get the level of depth and detail you need without having to hunt for what you want.
