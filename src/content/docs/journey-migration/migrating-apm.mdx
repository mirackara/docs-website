While setting up infrastructure monitoring provides a great foundation for understanding your systems, the best way to truly know your data comes from monitoring application performance. New Relic APM provides extensive, unified monitoring for all your applications. 

That means we can better link your data through your apps and integrations, and provide more focused information for you through curated dashboards. That way, you get the level of depth and detail you need without having to hunt for what you want. And you can try out our extensive APM capabilities [absolutely free](https://newrelic.com/signup).

## Your APM solution [#apm-solution]

You may be used to `integrations` in Datadog, but in New Relic, we call these capabilities APM `agents`. We've set up our agents for both convenience and functionality. At New Relic, our agents are focused around language and linking the data they collect to other entities you've installed. 

For example, an installed Java agent will collect metrics about your Java app (as well as your logs, events, and traces), and links together with an installed Ruby agent which does the same for Ruby. They link up with your infrastructure agents to provide a comprehensive, real-time view of all the data across your entire system, no matter the source.  Our agents let you:

* Monitor the performance and health of your apps in one central location.
* User New Relic with open source tools such as OpenTelemetry.
* Automatically instrument metrics, events, and traces.
* Ingest your logs automatically.
* Manage service security without prior configuration.

## Get started with New Relic APM monitoring [#get-started]

Once the setup is complete, your APM data in New Relic is found in the **APM and services** section of the UI, which is the equivalent of the **APM** section in Datadog. You can follow a guided install for most of our agents at any time within [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com) by selecting **Add Data > All > Guided install**, then selecting your agent from the **APM (Application Monitoring)** section.

You can also install our APM agents directly by using any of the tiles below. Our guided installs walk you through the setup procedures for any of our APM agents so that you can observe your data right away. All you need is a [free account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and an application to monitor and you're ready to begin!

## Add preconfigured dashboards or alerts [#add-dashboard-alert]

New Relic provides out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts for your APM agents the same way we do for infrastructure. These premade solutions are created by both New Relic and the community, which means they're always being expanded upon. 

<img
    title="Premade alerts"
    alt="An image displaying some of New Relic's premade APM alerts"
    src={journeyAPMPrefabAlerts}
/>

Go to **Add Data > Application monitoring**, then select either the **Dashboards** or **Alerts** tab. You'll see a list of preset dashboards and alerts to choose from, this time configured for application monitoring. You just need to choose one, select the account you want to add it to, and setup your data source, just like with infrastructure equivalents. You can customize what they do to tailor them to your specific needs once you've set them up, giving you all the data you need and none of the data you don't.
