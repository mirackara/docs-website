If you've followed our tutorial series, you've learned a little about how New Relic works firsthand. You've instrumented your entities for infrastructure, applications, and logs to start really seeing how your stack works together. You've setup a premade dashboard to visualize the data across your stack, and you've set up an alert or two to help monitor issues that could arise with your systems. 

But what if you need to do more with your data? What if you need to use synthetic monitors to test your agents to make sure everything runs smoothly without customer interaction? What if you need to query hyper-specific data points to uncover in-depth information that you can't find anywhere else? What if you need an observability solution that's low on cost but still high on functionality? 

Digging deeper into New Relic features will help you do all that and more, and you can continue to explore the platform [for free](https://newrelic.com/signup). One of our core principle is to help anyone do their best work every day using their data at every phase of development. Once you make the switch, you'll never look at your data the same way again.

Note for Competitive: What are some cool things that NR can do that DD can't that we can put here? Would love feedback on how to improve the above section!

## Do more with your data [#do-more]

New Relic has a host of features that enable you to maximize the information you get from your data. You can use any of the following to learn more about and do more with anything you plug in to our platform. Some features we think you'll like the most are: 

<Callout variant="tip">
For SMEs: I'd love to have access to some marketing-y material to link to in each of these features as well as documentation. Some of the text is based on information found on our main site, so I'd love something more in-depth if you have any resources you can share!

    Create tests using synthetic input to simulate traffic, resolve ability issues, and measure uptime with zero effects for your customer. 
        * Simulated traffic can be public or private across thousands of possible locations.
        * Find out about sub-optimal performance before your customers have a chance to know about them.
        * Get full context on your stack to identify specifically where your issues are arising from.
        * Use our synthetic testing in pre-production environments, or adjust any pages that are already in production.

    Learn more about synthetics in our **MARKETING MATERIAL**, or see our [introduction to synthetics](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/) documentation.

    Get complete and total observability for your web pages, whether your site is large or small. Measure your core web vitals and errors to ensure a satisfying customer experience from the first click to the last.
        * Install browser agents as quickly as you would any other using our guided installations.
        * Find out what's causing issues with how customers interact with your site from the beginning to the end of a transaction.
        * Monitor your AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and more as they occur in real time so you can resolve any issues before they become problems.
        * Customize your monitoring charts and share them across your organization so everyone has the same context you do.

    Get every data point from every single trace in one centralized location. Find only what you need among your trace when you need it, and eliminate hunting through pages of data to identify issues when they arise. 
        * Automatically instrument distributed tracing to start observing your data almost instantly.
        * Utilize the seemless integration with our APM agents and let the two features work in tandem to reduce your workload.
        * Capture representative activity samples with our head-based sampling approach.
        * Take advantage of our **Infinite Tracing**, a feature that users tail-based sampling approaches that gathers information at the end of a trace and lets you know what's most important.

    >
    Maximizing your data requires the ability to query what you need down to the smallest detail, and that's exactly what New Relic's query language (NRQL) provides. Similar to ANSI SQL, you can use our language as a foundation to get any number of details about your data in our platform.
        * Build charts, dashboards, and alerts from anywhere in our platform using the NRQL console. 
        * Take advantage of our free tutorials and New Relic University courses to learn everything you need to know about the language. 
        * Explore your data in ways no other platform can provide and get every detail on any aspect of observability.
        * Use NRQL to make queries and perform specific configurations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API.
    Learn more about [how NRQL works](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works/), or see our [introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) documentation.

    As your stack grows, security issues become an ever growing problem to tackle. Our vulnerability management solution gives you insight into what you need so that you can make sure to maintain compliance across your entire system.
        * Sync up security with all of your teams from one centralized location and streamline issue management.
        * Prevent accidental vulnerabilities and breaches across your entire organization with automatic identification. 
        * Detect your vulnerabilities in minutes, letting you fix them before they grow into large-scale problems.
        * See recommended updates automatically and ensure you're up-to-date on all your security needs.

    Collaboration across different development teams can be challenging, requiring developers to go back and forth between multiple tools to get anything done. New Relic's CodeStream makes it easier by allowing you to see your data, then discuss and review code, all within your IDE.
        * See your telemetry in context, allowing developers across teams to collaborate without missing out on valuable information.
        * Integrate with VS Code, Visual Studio, and all JetBrains editors as easily as adding an extension.
        * View code-level metrics to fully understand production environment performance.
        * Collaborate more easily across all your tools, such as GitHub, Slack, Teams, and email.
