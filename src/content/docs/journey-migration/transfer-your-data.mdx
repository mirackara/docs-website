import journeyAbnormalLCP from 'images/browser_screenshot-crop_LCP-abnormal.png'

Why should I make the transfer between DD and NR instead of just starting from scratch?
What do I need to make the transfer? What parts from DD go to what parts of NR?
Where do I find the places in NR to begin ingesting data? Where do I go in NR once the data is ingested?
How do I make the transfer? How do I check that the transfer is completed successfully?
