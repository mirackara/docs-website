        Monitoring your infrastructure can be daunting. Gathering the data from your servers, databases, cloud platforms, and hosted services is only the first task, and once you've set all that up, you still need to find ways to make sense of it all. 

        That's where New Relic comes in. Not only do our guided installs and pre-configured dashboards and alerts help you get up and running quickly, our tools will help you proactively troubleshoot and improve your infrastructure. Whether you want to view one host or one thousand, you can do everything you need from one central location without having to hunt for the data you need.

        ## Your infrastructure monitoring solution [#infra-solution]

        New Relic makes it easy for you to see what's going on inside your infrastructure, whether it runs in the cloud or dedicated hosts. In Datadog, you may be familiar with these capabilities as **agents**, and we call the same infrastructure capabilities **agents** at New Relic as well. Here's how we organize our infrastructure agents and integrations:

        * Infrastructure agents for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems with guided and manual install options
        * An agent for for [Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration/)
        * Cloud agents for Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform that you can install independently of our infrastructure agents
        * On-host integration agents for services like MySQL, Apache, Docker, and Kafka that work together with our infrastructure agent to maximize your data reporting

        As long as your system and on-host integrations meet our [minimum requirements](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent/), all you need to try is a [free New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and you can start right away.

        ## Get started with New Relic infrastructure monitoring [#get-started]

        Your infrastructure data in New Relic is located in the [**one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure**](https://one.newrelic.com/infra) section of the UI, exactly the same as Datadog. The fastest way to get an infrastructure monitor up and running can be done through our [guided installation](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==) path, which you can find within [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com) by selecting **Add Data > All > Guided install**.

            While setting up infrastructure monitoring provides a great foundation for understanding your systems, the best way to truly know your stack comes from monitoring your application performance. New Relic APM provides extensive, unified monitoring for all your applications. 

            That means we can better link your data through your apps and integrations, and provide more focused information for you through curated dashboards. That way, you get the level of depth and detail you need without having to hunt for what you want. And you can try out our extensive APM capabilities [absolutely free](https://newrelic.com/signup).

            <img
                title="APM overview"
                alt="An image displaying New Relic's APM monitoring page"
                src={journeyAPMDash}
            />

            ## Your APM solution [#apm-solution]

            You may be used to **integrations** in Datadog, but in New Relic, we call these capabilities APM **agents**. We've set up our agents to give you deep detail about your app's performance while still being easy to setup. At New Relic, our agents are focused around language and linking the data they collect to other entities you've installed. 

            For example, an installed Java agent will collect metrics about your Java app (as well as your logs, events, and traces), and links together with an installed Ruby agent which does the same for Ruby. They link up with your infrastructure agents to provide a comprehensive, real-time view of all the data across your entire system, no matter the source.  Our agents let you:

            * Monitor the performance and health of your apps in one central location
            * Use New Relic with open source tools such as OpenTelemetry
            * Automatically instrument metrics, events, and traces
            * Ingest your logs automatically
            * Manage service security without prior configuration

            ## Get started with New Relic APM monitoring [#get-started]

            Once the setup is complete, your APM data in New Relic is found in the **APM and services** section of the UI, which is the equivalent of the **APM** section in Datadog. You can follow a guided install for most of our agents at any time within [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com) by selecting **one.newrelic.com > Add Data > All > Guided install**, then selecting your agent from the **APM (Application Monitoring)** section.

            You can also install our APM agents directly by using any of the tiles below. Our guided install walks you through the setup procedures for any of our APM agents so that you can observe your data right away. All you need is a [free account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and an application to monitor and you're ready to begin!

## Explore premade dashboards [#add-dashboard]

New Relic provides out-of-the-box dashboards from the moment you set up an infrastructure integration. These dashboards are pre-configured, allowing you to begin visualizing your data with zero setup time. 

<img
    title="Premade dashboards"
    alt="An image displaying some of New Relic's premade infrastructure dashboards"
    src={journeyNewDash}
/>

Some of the most important areas that our infrastructure dashboards automatically cover are:
* Event data for your hosts, including metric data, the ability to filter by host, and notifications about your system health under the **Hosts** tab.
* Entries for any applications you choose to integrate under the **Inventory** tab.
* Granular details for each event under the **Events** tab, filterable by agents, alerts, and integrations with a single click.
* Access to your application based integrations, like AWS and Azure, accessible in one click from the sidebar.
* Easily open up the settings pages for your **Agents** and **Alerts** from the sidebar without having to leave the dashboard. 

## Add preconfigured alerts [#alerts]

Go to [**one.newrelic.com > Add Data > Infrastructure & OS**](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=e0a1fd90-4dc6-aef2-a0ae-49775c21d033), then select the **Alerts** tab. You'll see a list of preset alerts to choose from. Once you add one to your account, you can customize the conditions to whatever you need them to be. Just select the option you want, add your account, plug-in your data with our guided install, and you'll be set! For more information on setting up premade alerts, see our [documentation on adding dashboards and alerts](/docs/journey-migration/migrating-dashboards/).
