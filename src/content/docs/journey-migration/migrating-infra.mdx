Intro - Why you should migrate Infrastructure from NR to DD.
* We have quickstart options for infra (recommended) and non-quickstart options 
* New Relic has a robust monitoring system through apps, but setting up infrastructure gives you insight into (infra stuff)
* Quick bullet list of capabilities and strengths of Infra monitoring (no "sales" language or tone)
* Add a dashboard and an alert using the quickstarts if possible
