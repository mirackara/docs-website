Monitoring your infrastructure can be a seemingly daunting task at first glance. Gathering the data from your servers, databases, cloud platforms, and hosted services is only the first task, and once you've set all that up, you still need to find ways to make sense of it all. 

That's where New Relic comes in. We make setting up infrastructure monitoring for common services simple with our guided installation options. We'll show you how to get started below, and even help you get set-up with preconfigured dashboards and alerts to get you set up with a comprehensive infrastructure monitor in as little time as possible.

## Your infrastructure monitoring solution

New Relic makes it easy for you to observe your entire infrastructure, whether it runs in the cloud or dedicated hosts. Here are a few of the options for New Relic infrastructure monitoring:

* Infrastructure agents for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
* Integrations for Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Pixie.
* Cloud integrations for Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
* On-host integrations for services like MySQL, NGINX, Cassandra, and Kafka.

## Get started with New Relic infrasctructure monitoring WIP

Your infrastructure data in New Relic is located in the [Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra) section of the UI, exactly the same as Datadog. The fastest way to get an infrastructure monitor up and running can be done through our [guided installation](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==) path, which you can find within [New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com) by selecting **Add Data > All > Guided install**. In this example, we'll install an infrastructure monitor for Windows OS:
