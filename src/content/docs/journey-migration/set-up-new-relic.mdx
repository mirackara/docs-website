import journeyAbnormalLCP from 'images/browser_screenshot-crop_LCP-abnormal.png'

Why do I need to set New Relic up beforehand (instead of, for example, doing it as I go?)
What parts of New Relic need to be set up?
Where can I find the parts of NR that need to be set up?
How do I make sure I have what's needed?

The customer is expected to begin this step having gathered everything they need from step one and no information on NR. The customer should be guided through the various parts of NR needed for the transfer and end this step knowing where everything is with a brief idea of how everything fits together.
