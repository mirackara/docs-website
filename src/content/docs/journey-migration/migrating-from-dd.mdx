You can decide to switch data monitoring products for a variety of reasons. Maybe you've read an article or watched a video about a feature unique to New Relic that sparked your interest. Maybe you want to take a more comprehensive approach to your data while having the ability to identify issues as they arise from your monitored services. Or maybe you just want to try something new and see how it works for your organization. Whatever the reason, you can try New Relic without needing to fully migrate from Datadog. Best of all, you can try out New Relic for free.
