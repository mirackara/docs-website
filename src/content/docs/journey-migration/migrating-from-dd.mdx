You can decide to switch data monitoring products for a variety of reasons. Maybe you've read an article or watched a video about a feature unique to New Relic that sparked your interest. Maybe you want to take a more comprehensive approach to your data while having the ability to identify issues as they arise from your monitored services. Or maybe you just want to try something new and see how it works for your organization. 

Whatever the reason, you can try New Relic without needing to fully migrate from Datadog. You'll get full access to all 16 of our tools for whatever fits best for your team. Best of all, you can do it all for free.

We've provided a series of tutorials to help you get started monitoring your data with New Relic. Below, you'll find information on setting up monitoring for infrastructure and kubernetes, logs, and dashboards. 

You'll also find out how to use New Relic's wide array of agents to help you monitor nearly any application. You can also test your monitoring with synthetics and create alerts in each of the tutorials.
