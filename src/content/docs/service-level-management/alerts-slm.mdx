One of the promised outcomes of implementing service levels is that you will be able to adjust your alert policies and cut notifications down to those issues that are actually damaging your client experience and pose a risk to your business.

When you set service level objectives, you can configure alerts that will inform you in case of exhaustion of your error budget before the end of the compliance period. These alerts will show you when high business impact incidents occur. When triggered, they should be given priority, and you should engage the relevant teams to start diagnosing the source of the problem.

## Alerting on error budget burn rate [#alert-error-budget]

The idea behind burn rate alerts is that the error budget represents how many bad events you can afford over the SLO period; by definition, if you spend all your error budget at a constant rate, your burn rate = 1. Then, any burn rate above the tolerable burn rate would not be sustainable because you would have completely burnt the error budget before the end of the SLO period; therefore, you might want to get alerted if that's the case for a continued amount of time.

### Create alerts on error budget burn rate [#create-alert-error-budget]

You'll find the option to create alerts on the service level summary and alert conditions pages.

When clicking on it, a side panel will open, and you'll see the option to alert on the fast-burn rate at the top of the list.

The fast-burn alert follows Google's recommendation for SLO budget consumption percentages, specifically for fast-burn alerts. These alerts will warn you of a sudden, significant change in consumption that, if uncorrected, will exhaust your error budget very soon. We will set a 2% SLO budget consumption within 1 hour, meaning the service would consume the error budget entirely in 50 hours if left unattained.

You'll need to select an existing alert policy or create a new one to continue.

Alternatively, you can click 'Customize' and set your own thresholds. 

## Alerting on error budget consumption [#alert-consumption]

This alert will warn you once you have consumed 80% of your error budget for the period.

To set it up, click **Alert** on the service level summary or alert conditions pages, and select the **Error budget consumption** option.

You'll need to select an existing alert policy or create a new one to continue.

If you want to set a different threshold, click 'Customize' and follow the steps on the alert configuration card.

## Alerting on SLO attainment 

If you want to set up an alert for when your SLO goes below its target for an extended period, you can select the ‘SLO compliance’ option.

If your SLI is volatile, this type of alert might have low precision. Therefore, you should use a burn rate alert instead to mitigate it.


## Setting up your own error budget burn rate thresholds

If you don't want to follow Google’s recommendation for fast-burn alerts, you can set up your own thresholds.

### Set your condition thresholds [#condition-thresholds]

The error budget burn rate indicates how fast the service consumes the error budget, taking into account the whole SLO period. Here's a formula for calculating it:

```sql
critical burn rate = (tolerated budget consumption * SLO period [h]) / (evaluation period [h])
```

* Tolerated budget consumption: How much budget you tolerate to consume in the evaluation period. 
* SLO period: time window of your SLO (generally, in hours).
* Evaluation period: aggregation window we are taking into consideration (you can use 1 hour on the alert condition aggregation window for simplicity).

However, considering that the maximum error rate that can ever occur is 100%, it means that there is also a maximum burn rate and therefore the critical burn rate must be in the range of:
```
0 < critical burn rate < maximum burn rate
```

Where the maximum burn rate value is calculated as follows:
```
maximum burn rate = 1 / (1 - SLO target)
```

Finally, in order to define your alert threshold, you will multiply the critical burn rate per hour by the error budget:

```sql
threshold = error budget * critical burn rate 
```

#### Example [#condition-thresholds-example]

Let's see how this works with an example for a **28 day** SLO with a **99.9%** target.

For a 28 day SLO, Google recommends alerting on a **2%** SLO budget consumption **in the last hour**. That means that if you keep burning the budget at the same rate, you would breach your SLO in 50 hours (resulting from `100% / 2%`).

Then we have the following variables:
* SLO target: `99.9%`
* SLO period: `28 days (28 * 24 hours)`
* Tolerated budget consumption: `2% (0.02)`
* Evaluation period: `1 hour`

Therefore:
```
critical burn rate per hour = (0.02 * 28 * 24) / 1 = 13.44
```

Where the maximum possible burn rate value for the SLO is:
```
maximum burn rate = 1 / (1 - 0.999) = 1000
```

And finally:
```
threshold = 0.1 * 13.44 = 1.344
```

This would be a value that you would use as the alert condition threshold: Open a violation when the query returns a value above the threshold (in this example, 1.344), at least once in the evaluation period (in this example, 60 minutes).

<Callout variant="important">
If you edit the SLO target on the Service levels side, remember to edit the target on the alert condition as well.
</Callout>

### Settings [#extra-settings]

It's important to tune the additional parameters of this alert condition. 

Set the window duration to the evaluation period. Following the previous example, you would set **60 minutes**, meaning the alert system would aggregate 60 minutes of data.

<Callout variant="important">
The evaluation period supports aggregating up to 2 hours of data.
</Callout>

You can use a **60 seconds** slide by interval, so that every minute New Relic evaluates the 60 previous minutes of data.

<img
  title="Alerts period.png"
  alt="Alerts evaluation period"
  src={alertsAdvancedSignalSettingsSlm}
/>

Next, connect the condition to the policy that determines how notifications are managed. 

Last, you can choose when to automatically close any open violations.

### Limitations [#limitations]

New Relic Alerts can aggregate up to 2 hours of data. Therefore, New Relic does not yet provide the ability to alert on SLO compliance over the whole SLO period.
