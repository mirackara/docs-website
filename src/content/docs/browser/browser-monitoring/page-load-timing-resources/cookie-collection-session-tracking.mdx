Browser monitoring's [page load timing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) feature can track sessions by using the sessionStorage API that can store a simple session identifier.

## How it works [#process]

Here is the basic process for session tracking:

1. A session begins when a user visits a website where New Relic's browser monitoring is installed and the privacy setting for tracking is enabled.
2. As the user's page is loaded, our browser monitoring script sets a simple session identifier in the browser.
3. The script then reads the ID on subsequent page loads, reloads and restores, within the same tab.
4. The same session will continue until the user's tab/window is closed.

Session tracking will not work properly in these situations:

* If users have DOM Storage disabled in their browser.
* If the browser or page is configured to **not** allow loading and execution of third-party origin scripts through security policies or other means (which naturally means the agent as a whole will not function).

## Enable or disable tracking [#settings]

At New Relic, we take data privacy seriously. By default, we do not retain any personal data collected by our browser agent, and you can control session tracking.  If you want to enable or disable session tracking on web browsers of visitors to your website:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**.
2. In your app's **Privacy** settings, toggle **Session tracking**.
