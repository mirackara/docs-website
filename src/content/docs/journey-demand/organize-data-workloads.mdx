title: Align your teams with workloads
metaDescription: "If you're preparing for a peak event day, you can set up workloads that pulls the most relevant data and puts it in front of the teams that need it."

To start from a strong position on gameday, we recommend creating workloads during the planning phase. Beyond application health and resource allocation, the choreography of a gameday depends on data alignment and strong communication. A workload lets you define the data that's important to you, then centralizes that data into one area of the UI. The data that appears in a workload can be service levels, browser apps, services, databases, dashboards, or hosts.

## Objectives [#objective]

This tutorial gives a primer on using workloads for a peak performance day. You will:

* Create your first workload
* Customize your workload for your gameday event

## Create a workload for game day [#create]

To get started with workloads, go to **[one.newrelic.com > Workloads](https://one.newrelic.com/workloads)**, then click **Create a workload**.

The **Create a workload** page lists data sources from all the accounts you have access to. If there's a capability, service, component, or resource that's reporting to New Relic, you can add it to a workload.  

To create a workload: 

1. Select the account that owns the workload. 
2. Name your workload, something like `Peak Demand Data` or anything else meaningful to your team. 
3. Query for the sources that you want represented in your workload. 

To get the most out of workloads, we recommend you add:

* APM services, hosts, service levels, synthetic monitors, load balancers, Kubernetes pods or even other workloads.
* `log` to your workloads query for easy access to the logs UI page.
* Relevant dashboards to a workload, such as a dashboard that only displays your KPIs, or a dashboard of business critical transactions.

Once you've whittled down your selection, you have two options for adding a data source to a workload. Both do slightly different things.

* **Add** adds the source in a static state. For example, if you added a dashboard at noon, but added more widgets to that dashboard at 1pm, those additional widgets wouldn't appear in the workload. 
* **Add this query** adds the entity dynamically. Using the same dashboard example, the 1pm changes (and any future changes) would automatically appear in the workload.

## Add dashboards to workloads [#dash]

If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team, you can link those <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When you select that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied.
