New Relic Synthetic Monitoring is a tool that allows you to simulate user interactions with your website or application, and monitor its performance and availability across thousands of public and private locations to proactively detect and resolve issues.

Now you can see a visual representation of a adjustable table that displays the success and failure result, the location, the time, and the key metrics such as response time, error rate, and availability. Through this table, youâ€™ll be able to quickly identify any issues and take corrective action. You can customize the tables to show the data that's most important to you, and set up alerts to notify you when performance or availability thresholds are exceeded. Overall, Synthetic Monitoring Tables are a useful tool for monitoring and maintaining the health of your website or application.
