Your company projected a peak demand period during their upcoming event. You've been tasked with something that, at its surface, seems fairly straight forward: keep your app performing for customers. But the request is as complex as your org is, with many teams owning many different capabilities across the product. How do you move forward? How can you ease planning?

This tutorial can help you prepare for a game day. First, it'll guide you through some basic planning recommendations, including setting service levels, assessing your alerts, and creating workloads, then it shows you an example of following the data when responding to incidents.

Let's get started.

## Instrument with the infrastructure and APM agents [#instrument]

In order to start preparing for gameday, you need to find your baselines. To find your baselines, you need to figure out how your entire system performs on an ordinary day. Baselining is a core concept for capacity planning and it's a practice you ideally incorporate over a period of several months. Regardless of where you're at in this process, however, you want to instrument your system with our agents, which report data to New Relic.  

* Install the infrastructure agent with our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=3a7ae2fd-163d-77a7-9372-b4764acf286e). By installing the infrastructure agent, you'll get out of the box data about CPU, memory, and file utilization.
* Install the APM agent with our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=b3815b2d-8711-4418-335b-a9cac0468fe3). The APM agent collects data about throughput, response time, and any errors.

These are two separate guided install processes that report two different sets of data. Taken together, they give you a foundation assess your needs for gameday.

## Capacity planning 101 [#capacity]

Congratulations! You've instrumented with a couple New Relic agents and have data flowing in. But New Relic's power isn't in the fact that data is reporting, though that *is* important. New Relic's power is its ability to surface the data that matters to you, your team, and your boss. The data exposed with New Relic can shape your capacity planning process and guide you to understanding your system architecture with more intimacy than you had before. 

Capacity planning is the period of time before a peak event. You make assessments about your system after collecting data over a period of months. You then determine how well your system performs on an ordinary day with the intent of testing how far your system can be pushed before breaking. The goal is one part landing on cost effective resource allocation, one part exposing your system's weaknesses, and one part dress rehearsal. Does your team know how to communicate with other teams? Are all teams aligned around the same data? Are you confident with your observability tools?

## Seeing the forest for the trees [#trees]

Let's circle back to why we're here: you're tasked with maintaining performance during peak demand. You might assume this means maintaining total perfection across your stack, but it doesn't. Rather, it means making a series of prioritization decisions so customers can do what they've set out to do, whether that's logging in, adding an item to a cart, or making a purchase. 

New Relic is a dynamic tool that provides different entry points into your system. And with our two agents instrumented to your system, you'll be receiving a *lot* of data. This is both a good and bad thing, especially in the context of gameday. It's good that you know the answer is somewhere in the forest, but how do you start using that data? How can you make that data work for you?

This tutorial ultimately introduces some basic tools that get you started with peak demand planning. Though not exhaustive, it'll walk you through the tools we recommend for peak performance planning with some explanation about how to incorporate them into your planning. Beyond that, we'll talk about incident response on the day in question. This tutorial has a few different outcomes.

* If you're looking to plan your infrastructure, you'll install an integration that reports New Relic data to your Kubernetes cluster so it autoscales when demand peaks
* If you're handling incident response on gameday, you'll create service levels on business-critical capabilities
* You'll evaluate your alerts in order to reduce redundancy and noise, and create new alerts on your new service levels
* Set up workloads that align your team with other teams
