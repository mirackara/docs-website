Capacity planning is when you assess your system while collecting data over a period of several months. You'll determine how well your system performs on an ordinary day with the intent of testing how far you can push your system before an outage. Ideally, exposing your system's weaknesses leads to a plan that strikes a balance between making a functionally great system and cost effectiveness, all while preparing your team for the peak event. Are all teams aligned around the same data? Do they know how to communicate?

You might assume preparing for gameday means creating and maintaining total perfection across your system, but it doesn't. Rather, it means making a series of prioritization decisions that revolve around customer experience, whether that's logging in, adding an item to a cart, or making a purchase.

## Objectives [#objective]

This tutorial introduces some basic tools that get you started with peak demand planning. Though not exhaustive, it walks through our recommendations for peak performance planning with some explanation about how to incorporate them into incident response. 

* If you're looking to scale your infrastructure, you'll install an integration that reports New Relic data to your Kubernetes cluster so it autoscales when demand peaks
* If you're handling incident response on gameday, you'll create service levels on business-critical capabilities
* You'll evaluate your alerts and reduce redundancy and noise, and create new alerts on your new service levels
* You'll set up workloads that align everyone on gameday

## Instrument with the infrastructure and APM agents [#instrument]

In order to start preparing for gameday, you need to find your baselines. To find your baselines, you need to figure out how your entire system performs on an ordinary day. Baselining is a core concept for capacity planning and it's a practice you ideally incorporate over a period of several months. Regardless of where you're at in this process, however, you want to instrument your system with our agents, which report data to New Relic.  

* Install the infrastructure agent with our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=3a7ae2fd-163d-77a7-9372-b4764acf286e). By installing the infrastructure agent, you'll get out of the box data about CPU, memory, and file utilization.
* Install the APM agent with our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=b3815b2d-8711-4418-335b-a9cac0468fe3). The APM agent collects data about throughput, response time, and any errors.

These are two separate guided install processes that report two different sets of data. Taken together, they give you a foundation assess your needs for gameday.

## What's next? [#capacity]

Congratulations! You've instrumented with a couple New Relic agents and have data flowing in. But New Relic's power isn't in the fact that data is reporting, though that *is* important. New Relic's power is its ability to surface the data that matters to you, your team, and your boss. The data exposed with New Relic can shape your capacity planning process and guide you to understanding your system architecture with more intimacy than you had before.
