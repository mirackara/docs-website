If New Relic is a forest, then your ingested data is the thousands of trees inside it. You may know about the kinds of trees in your forest, but finding the ones you want can feel daunting. To take the metaphor further: if New Relic is a forest, then you can think of workloads as a map of regions. 

In your planning phase, you can align your teams by creating workloads that centralize data in one area. Maybe you've made workloads for individual teams, or maybe you've gone further and created a workload for gameday. In essence, your workloads consist of anything that reports data and anything organizing that data, like dashboards.

## Why workloads? [#why]

To start from a strong position on gameday, we recommend creating workloads during the planning phase. Beyond application health and resource allocation, gameday comes with its own tensions as priorities differ across teams. Workloads mitigate that tension and centralize information in one area. Additionally, they allow teams to start the incident discovery phase in one area rather than asking them to scatter across different UI pages. 

To find workloads in the UI:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**, then click **Workloads** from the **Your system** category. 
2. At the top right of the waterfall view, click **Create a workload**.

## Create a workload for game day

The **Create a workload** page lists entities from all the accounts you have access to. New Relic attaches tags to your data out of the box, but you can go back and add your own customized tags to anything that's reporting data. Tags drive workloadsâ€”if you know there's an entity you want to monitor for gameday, give it a tag so you can easily add it to a workload. If you want to organize your workloads by team, then introduce a team tag. 

To create a workload: 

1. Select the account that owns the workload. 
2. Name your workload, something like `Peak Demand Data` or anything else meaningful for your team. 
3. Query for the sources that you want represented in your workload. 

If it's reporting to New Relic, you can add it to a workload. Some common entities are APM services, hosts, service levels, synthetic monitors, load balancers, Kubernetes pods or even other workloads. 

Once you've whittled down your selection, you have two options for adding a data source to a workload. Both do slightly different things.

* **Add** adds the entity in a static state. For example, if you added a dashboard at noon, but added more widgets to that dashboard at 1pm, those additional widgets wouldn't appear in the workload. 
* **Add this query** adds the entity dynamically. Using the same dashboard example, the 1pm changes and any future changes would automatically appear in the workload.

## Get the most out of workloads 

To get the most power out of workloads, we recommend you add these sources to your query:

* A gameday-specific tag that you can attach to multiple kinds of data sources, relevant to you.  
* Add `log` to your workloads query for easy access to the logs UI page.
* Add relevant dashboards to a workload, such as a dashboard that only displays your KPIs, or a dashboard of business critical transactions.
